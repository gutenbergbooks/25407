    <p>
      The Emperor Charlemagne and his twelve peers, having taken the palmer&rsquo;s
      staff at Saint-Denis, made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. They prostrated
      themselves before the tomb of Our Lord, and sat in the thirteen chairs of
      the great hall wherein Jesus Christ and his Apostles met together to
      celebrate the blessed sacrifice of the Mass. Then they fared to
      Constantinople, being fain to see King Hugo, who was renowned for his
      magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King welcomed them in his Palace, where, beneath a golden dome, birds
      of ruby, wrought with a wondrous art, sat and sang in bushes of emerald.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated the Emperor of France and the twelve Counts about a table loaded
      with stags, boars, cranes, wild geese, and peacocks, served in pepper. And
      he offered his guests, in ox-horns, the wines of Greece and Asia to drink.
      Charlemagne and his companions quaffed all these wines in honour of the
      King and his daughter, the Princess Helen. After supper Hugo led them to
      the chamber where they were to sleep. Now this chamber was circular, and a
      column, springing in the midst thereof, carried the vaulted roof. Nothing
      could be finer to look upon. Against the walls, which were hung with gold
      and purple, twelve beds were ranged, while another greater than the rest
      stood beside the pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlemagne lay in this, and the Counts stretched themselves round about
      him on the others. The wine they had drunk ran hot in their veins, and
      their brains were afire. They could not sleep, and fell to making brags
      instead, and laying of wagers, as is the way of the knights of France,
      each striving to outdo the other in warranting himself to do some doughty
      deed for to manifest his prowess. The Emperor opened the game. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them fetch me, a-horseback and fully armed, the best knight King Hugo
      hath. I will lift my sword and bring it down upon him in such wise it
      shall cleave helm and hauberk, saddle and steed, and the blade shall delve
      a foot deep underground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Guillaume d&rsquo;Orange spake up after the Emperor and made the second brag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a ball of iron sixty men can scarce lift, and
      hurl it so mightily against the Palace wall that it shall beat down sixty
      fathoms&rsquo; length thereof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ogier, the Dane, spake next.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye see yon proud pillar which bears up the vault. To-morrow will I tear
      it down and break it like a straw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After which Renaud de Montauban cried with an oath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Od&rsquo;s life! Count Ogier, whiles you overset the pillar, I will clap the
      dome on my shoulders and hale it down to the seashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gérard de Rousillon it was made the fifth brag.
    </p>
    <p>
      He boasted he would uproot single-handed, in one hour, all the trees in
      the Royal pleasaunce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aimer took up his parable when Gérard was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a magic hat,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;made of a sea-calf&rsquo;s skin, which renders
      me invisible. I will set it on my head, and to-morrow, whenas King Hugo is
      seated at meat, I will eat up his fish and drink down his wine, I will
      tweak his nose and buffet his ears. Not knowing whom or what to blame, he
      will clap all his serving-men in gaol and scourge them sore,&mdash;and we
      shall laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me,&rdquo; declared Huon de Bordeaux, whose turn it was, &ldquo;for me, I am so
      nimble I will trip up to the King and cut off his beard and eyebrows
      without his knowing aught about the matter. &lsquo;T is a piece of sport I will
      show you to-morrow. And I shall have no need of a sea-calf hat either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doolin de Mayence made his brag too. He promised to eat up in one hour all
      the figs and all the oranges and all the lemons in the King&rsquo;s orchards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next the Due Naisme said in this wise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith! <i>I</i> will go into the banquet hall, I will catch up
      flagons and cups of gold and fling them so high they will never light down
      again save to tumble into the moon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bernard de Brabant then lifted his great voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do better yet,&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;Ye know the river that flows by
      Constantinople is broad and deep, for it is come nigh its mouth by then,
      after traversing Egypt, Babylon, and the Earthly Paradise. Well, I will
      turn it from its bed and make it flood the Great Square of the City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gérard de Viane said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put a dozen knights in line of array. And I will tumble all the twelve on
      their noses, only by the wind of my sword.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the Count Roland laid the twelfth wager, in the fashion following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take my horn, I will go forth of the city and I will blow such a
      blast all the gates of the town will drop from their hinges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olivier alone had said no word yet. He was young and courteous, and the
      Emperor loved him dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Olivier, my son,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;will you not make your brag like the rest of
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right willingly, sire,&rdquo; Olivier replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name of Hercules of Greece?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, I have heard some discourse of him,&rdquo; said Charlemagne. &ldquo;He was an
      idol of the misbelievers, like the false god Mahound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, sire,&rdquo; said Olivier. &ldquo;Hercules of Greece was a knight among the
      Pagans and King of a Pagan kingdom. He was a gallant champion and stoutly
      framed in all his limbs. Visiting the Court of a certain Emperor who had
      fifty daughters, virgins, he wedded them all on one and the same night,
      and that so well and throughly that next morning they all avowed
      themselves well-contented women and with naught left to learn. He had not
      slighted ever a one of them. Well, sire, an you will, I will lay my wager
      to do after the fashion of Hercules of Greece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, beware, Olivier, my son,&rdquo; cried the Emperor, &ldquo;beware what you do;
      the thing would be a sin. I felt sure this King Hercules was a Saracen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; returned Olivier, &ldquo;know this&mdash;I warrant me to show in the
      same space of time the selfsame prowess with one virgin that Herailes of
      Greece did with fifty. And the maid shall be none other but the Princess
      Helen, King Hugo&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good and well,&rdquo; agreed Charlemagne; &ldquo;that will be to deal honestly and as
      a good Christian should. But you were in the wrong, my son, to drag the
      fifty virgins of King Hercules into your business, wherein, the Devil fly
      away with me else, I can see but one to be concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Olivier mildly, &ldquo;there is but one of a truth. But she
      shall win such satisfaction of me that, an I number the tokens of my love,
      you will to-morrow see fifty crosses scored on the wall, and that is <i>my</i>
      brag.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count Olivier was yet speaking when lo! the column which bare the
      vault opened. The pillar was hollow and contrived in such sort that a man
      could lie hid therein at his ease to see and hear everything. Charlemagne
      and the twelve Counts had never a notion of this; so they were sore
      surprised to behold the King of Constantinople step forth. He was white
      with anger and his eyes flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said in a terrible voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is how ye show your gratitude for the hospitality I offer you. Ye
      are ill-mannered guests. For a whole hour have ye been insulting me with
      your bragging wagers. Well, know this,&mdash;you, Sir Emperor, and ye, his
      knights; if to-morrow ye do not all of you make good your boasts, I will
      have your heads cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said his say, he stepped back within the pillar, which shut to
      again closely behind him. For a while the twelve paladins were dumb with
      wonder and consternation. The Emperor was the first to break the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comrades,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis true we have bragged too freely. Mayhap we have
      spoken things better unsaid. We have drunk overmuch wine, and have shown
      unwisdom. The chiefest fault is mine; I am your Emperor, and I gave you
      the bad example. I will devise with you to-morrow of the means whereby we
      may save us from this perilous pass; meantime, it behoves us to get to
      sleep. I wish you a good night. God have you in his keeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the Emperor and the twelve peers were snoring under their
      coverlets of silk and cloth of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      They awoke on the morrow, their minds still distraught and deeming the
      thing was but a nightmare. But anon soldiers came to lead them to the
      Palace, that they might make good their brags before the King&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; cried the Emperor, &ldquo;come; and let us pray God and His Holy Mother.
      By Our Lady&rsquo;s help shall we easily make good our brags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He marched in front with a more than human majesty of port. Arriving anon
      at the King&rsquo;s Palace, Charlemagne, Naisme, Aimer, Huon, Doolin, Guillaume,
      Ogier, Bernard, Renaud, the two Gérards, and Roland fell on their knees
      and, joining their hands in prayer, made this supplication to the Holy
      Virgin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, which art in Paradise, look on us now in our extremity; for love of
      the Realm of the Lilies, which is thine own, protect the Emperor of France
      and his twelve peers, and give them the puissance to make good their
      brags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter they rose up comforted and fulfilled of bright courage and
      gallant confidence, for they knew that Our Lady would answer their prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Hugo, seated on a golden throne, accosted them, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hour is come to make good your brags. But an if ye fail so to do, I
      will have your heads cut off. Begone therefore, straightway, escorted by
      my men-at-arms, each one of you to the place meet for the doing of the
      fine things ye have insolently boasted ye will accomplish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this order they separated and went divers ways, each followed by a
      little troop of armed men. Whiles some returned to the hall where they had
      passed the night, others betook them to the gardens and orchards. Bernard
      de Brabant made for the river, Roland hied him to the ramparts, and all
      marched valiantly. Only Olivier and Charlemagne tarried in the Palace,
      waiting, the one for the knight that he had sworn to cleave in twain, the
      other for the maiden he was to wed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in very brief while a fearful sound arose, awful as the last trump
      that shall proclaim to mankind the end of the world. It reached the Great
      Hall of the Palace, set the birds of ruby trembling on their emerald
      perches and shook King Hugo on his throne of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twas a noise of walls crumbling into ruin and floods roaring, and high
      above the din blared out an ear-splitting trumpet blast. Meanwhile
      messengers had come hurrying in from all quarters of the city, and thrown
      themselves trembling at the King&rsquo;s feet, bearing strange and terrible
      tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;sixty fathoms&rsquo; length of the city walls is fallen in at
      one crash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; cried another, &ldquo;the pillar which bare up your vaulted hall is
      broken down, and the dome thereof we have seen walking like a tortoise
      toward the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; faltered a third, &ldquo;the river, with its ships and its fishes, is
      pouring through the streets, and will soon be beating against your Palace
      walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      King Hugo, white with terror, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my faith! these men are wizards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sir King,&rdquo; Charlemagne addressed him with a smile on his lips, &ldquo;the
      Knight I wait for is long of coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King sent for him, and he came. He was a knight of stately stature and
      well armed. The good Emperor clave him in twain, as he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now while these things were a-doing, Olivier thought to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The intervention of Our Most Blessed Lady is plain to see in these
      marvels; and I am rejoiced to behold the manifest tokens she vouchsafes of
      her love for the Realm of France. Not in vain have the Emperor and his
      companions implored the succour of the Holy Virgin, Mother of God. Alas!
      <i>I</i> shall pay for all the rest, and have my head cut off. For I
      cannot well ask the Virgin Mary to help me make good <i>my</i> brag. &lsquo;Tis
      an enterprise of a sort wherein &lsquo;twould be indiscreet to crave the
      interference of Her who is the <i>Lily of Purity</i>, the <i>Tower of
      Ivory</i>, the <i>Guarded Door</i> and the <i>Fenced Orchard-Close</i>.
      And, lacking aid from on high, I am sore afraid I may not do so much as I
      have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus ran Olivier&rsquo;s thoughts, when King Hugo roughly accosted him with the
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is now your turn, Count, to fulfil your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Olivier, &ldquo;I am waiting with great impatience for the
      Princess your daughter. For you must needs do me the priceless grace of
      giving me her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is but fair,&rdquo; said King Hugo. &ldquo;I will therefore bid her come to you
      and a chaplain with her for to celebrate the marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At church, during the ceremony, Olivier reflected:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The maid is sweet and comely as ever a man could desire, and too fain am
      I to clip her in my arms to regret the brag I have made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, after supper, the Princess Helen and the Count Olivier were
      escorted by twelve ladies and twelve knights to a chamber, wherein the
      twain were left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they passed the night, and on the morrow guards came and led them
      both before King Hugo. He was on his throne, surrounded by his knights.
      Near by stood Charlemagne and the peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Count Olivier,&rdquo; demanded the King, &ldquo;is your brag made good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Olivier held his peace, and already was King Hugo rejoiced at heart to
      think his new son-in-law&rsquo;s head must fall. For of all the brags and
      boasts, it was Olivier&rsquo;s had angered him worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer,&rdquo; he stormed. &ldquo;Do you dare to tell me your brag is accomplished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the Princess Helen, blushing and smiling, spake with eyes
      downcast and in a faint voice, yet clear withal, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Yea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Right glad were Charlemagne and the peers to hear the Princess say this
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Hugo, &ldquo;these Frenchmen have God and the Devil o&rsquo; their
      side. It was fated I should cut off none of these knights&rsquo; heads.... Come
      hither, son-in-law,&rdquo;&mdash;and he stretched forth his hand to Olivier, who
      kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor Charlemagne embraced the Princess and said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Helen, I hold you for my daughter and my son&rsquo;s wife. You will go along
      with us to France, and you will live at our Court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as his lips lay on the Princess&rsquo;s cheek, he rounded softly in her
      ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spake as a loving-hearted woman should. But tell me this in closest
      confidence,&mdash;Did you speak the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, Olivier is a gallant man and a courteous. He was so full of pretty
      ways and dainty devices for to distract my mind, <i>I</i> never thought of
      counting. Nor yet did <i>he</i> keep score. Needs therefore must I hold
      him quit of his promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      King Hugo made great rejoicings for his daughter&rsquo;s nuptials. Thereafter
      Charlemagne and his twelve peers returned back to France, taking with them
      the Princess Helen.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      LENT, of the year 1429, presented a strange marvel of the Calendar, a
      conjunction that moved the admiration not only of the common crowd of the
      Faithful, but eke of Clerks, well learned in Arithmetic. For Astronomy,
      mother of the Calendar, was Christian in those days. In 1429 Good Friday
      fell on the Feast of the Annunciation, so that one and the same day
      combined the commemoration of the two several mysteries which did commence
      and consummate the redemption of mankind, and in wondrous wise
      superimposed one on top of the other, Jesus conceived in the Virgin&rsquo;s womb
      and Jesus dying on the Cross. This Friday, whereon the mystery of joy came
      so to coincide exactly with the mystery of sorrow, was named the &ldquo;Grand
      Friday,&rdquo; and was kept holy with solemn Feasts on Mount Anis, in the Church
      of the Annunciation. For many years, by gift of the Popes of Rome, the
      sanctuary of Mount Anis had possessed the privilege of the plenary
      indulgences of a great jubilee, and the late-deceased Bishop of Le Puy,
      Élie de Le-strange, had gotten Pope Martin to restore this <i>pardon</i>.
      It was a favour of the sort the Popes scarce ever refused, when asked in
      due and proper form.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>pardon</i> of the Grand Friday drew a great crowd of pilgrims and
      traders to Le Puy-en-Velay. As early as mid February folk from distant
      lands set out thither in cold and wind and rain. For the most part they
      fared on foot, staff in hand. Whenever they could, these pilgrims
      travelled in companies, to the end they might not be robbed and held to
      ransom by the armed bands that infested the country parts, and by the
      barons who exacted toll on the confines of their lands. Inasmuch as the
      mountain districts were especially dangerous, they tarried in the
      neighbouring towns, Clermont, Issoire, Brioude, Lyons, Issingeaux, Alais,
      till they were gathered in a great host, and then went forth on their road
      in the snow. During Holy Week a strange multitude thronged the hilly
      streets of Le Puy,&mdash;pedlars from Languedoc and Provence and
      Catalonia, leading their mules laded with leather goods, oil, wool, webs
      of cloth, or wines of Spain in goat-skins; lords a-horseback and ladies in
      wains, artisans and traders pacing on their mules, with wife or daughter
      perched behind, Then came the poor pilgrim folk, limping along, halting
      and hobbling, stick in hand and bag on back, panting up the stiff climb.
      Last were the flocks of oxen and sheep being driven to the
      slaughterhouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, leant against the wall of the Bishop&rsquo;s palace, stood Florent
      Guillaume, looking as long and dry and black as an espalier vine in
      winter, and devoured pilgrims and cattle with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he called to Marguerite the lace-maker, &ldquo;look at yonder fine heads
      of bestial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Marguerite, squatted beside her bobbins, called back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, fine beasts, and fat withal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the twain were very bare and scant of the goods of this world, and
      even then were feeling bitterly the pinch of hunger. And folk said it came
      of their own fault. At that very moment Pierre Grandmange the tripe-seller
      was saying as much, where he stood in his tripe-shop, pointing a finger at
      them. &ldquo;&lsquo;T would be sinful,&rdquo; he was crying, &ldquo;to give an alms to such
      good-for-nothing varlets.&rdquo; The tripe-seller would fain have been very
      charitable, but he feared to lose his soul by giving to evil-livers, and
      all the fat citizens of Le Puy had the selfsame scruples.
    </p>
    <p>
      To say truth, we must needs allow that, in the heyday of her hot youth,
      Marguerite the lace-maker had not matched St. Lucy in purity, St. Agatha
      in constancy, and St. Catherine in staidness. As for Florent Guillaume, he
      had been the best scrivener in the city. For years he had not had his
      equal for engrossing the Hours of Our Lady of Le Puy. But he had been over
      fond of merrymakings and junketings. Now his hand had lost its cunning,
      and his eye its clearness; he could no more trace the letters on the
      parchment with the needful steadiness of touch. Even so, he might have won
      his livelihood by teaching apprentices in his shop at the sign of the
      Image of Our Lady, under the choir buttresses of <i>The Annunciation</i>,
      for he was a fellow of good counsel and experience. But having had the ill
      fortune to borrow of Maître Jacquet Coquedouille the sum of six livres ten
      sous, and having paid him back at divers terms eighty livres two sous, he
      had found himself at the last to owe yet six livres two sous to the
      account of his creditor, which account was approved correct by the judges,
      for Jacquet Coquedouille was a sound arithmetician. This was the reason
      why the scrivenry of Florent Guillaume, under the choir buttresses of <i>The
      Annunciation</i>, was sold, on Saturday the fifth day of March, being the
      Feast of St. Theophilus, to the profit of Maître Jacquet Coquedouille.
      Since that time the poor penman had never a place to call his own. But by
      the good help of Jean Magne the bell-ringer and with the protection of Our
      Lady, whose Hours he had aforetime written, Florent Guillaume found a
      perch o&rsquo; nights in the steeple of the Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scrivener and the lace-maker had much ado to live. Marguerite only
      kept body and soul together by chance and charity, for she had long lost
      her good looks and she hated the lace-making. They helped each other.
      Folks said so by way of reproach; they had been better advised to account
      it to them for righteousness. Florent Guillaume was a learned clerk. Well
      knowing every word of the history of the beautiful Black Virgin of Le Puy
      and the ordering of the ceremonies of the great <i>pardon</i>, he had
      conceived the notion he might serve as guide to the pilgrims, deeming he
      would surely light on someone compassionate enough to pay him a supper in
      guerdon of his fine stories. But the first folk he had offered his
      services to had bidden him begone because his ragged coat bespoke neither
      good guidance nor clerkly wit; so he had come back, downhearted and
      crestfallen, to the Bishop&rsquo;s wall, where he had his bit of sunshine and
      his kind gossip Marguerite. &ldquo;They reckon,&rdquo; he said bitterly, &ldquo;I am not
      learned enough to number them the relics and recount the miracles of Our
      Lady. Do they think my wits have escaped away through the holes in my
      gaberdine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis not the wits,&rdquo; replied Marguerite, &ldquo;escape by the holes in a body&rsquo;s
      clothes, but the good natural heat. I am sore a-cold. And it is but too
      true that, man and woman, they judge us by our dress. The gallants would
      find me comely enough yet if I was accoutred like my Lady the Comtesse de
      Clermont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, all the length of the street in front of them the pilgrims were
      elbowing and fighting their way to the Sanctuary, where they were to win
      pardon for their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will surely suffocate anon,&rdquo; said Marguerite. &ldquo;Twenty-two years
      agone, on the Grand Friday, two hundred persons died stifled under the
      porch of <i>The Annunciation</i>. God have their souls in keeping! Ay,
      those were the good times, when I was young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis very true indeed, that year you tell of, two hundred pilgrims
      crushed each other to death and departed from this world to the other. And
      next day was never a sign to be seen of aught untoward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he so spake, Florent Guillaume noted a pilgrim, a very fat man, who was
      not hurrying to get him assoiled with the same hot haste as the rest, but
      kept rolling his wide eyes to right and left with a look of distress and
      fear. Florent Guillaume stepped up to him and louted low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messire,&rdquo; he accosted him, &ldquo;one may see at a glance you are a sensible
      man and an experienced; you do not rush blindly to the <i>pardon</i> like
      a sheep to the slaughter. The rest of the folk go helter-skelter thither,
      the nose of one under the tail of the other; but you follow a wiser
      fashion. Grant me the boon to be your guide, and you will not repent your
      bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim, who proved to be a gentleman of Limoges, answered in the
      patois of his countryside, that he had no use for a scurvy beggarman and
      could very well find his own way to <i>The Annunciation</i> for to receive
      pardon for his faults. And therewith he set his face resolutely to the
      hill. But Florent Guillaume cast himself at his feet, and tearing at his
      hair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! stop! messire,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;i&rsquo; God&rsquo;s name and by all the Saints, I
      warn you go no farther! &lsquo;T will be your death, and you are not the man we
      could see perish without grief and dolour. A few steps more and you are a
      dead man! They are suffocating up yonder. Already full six hundred
      pilgrims have given up the ghost. And this is but a small beginning! Do
      you not know, messire, that twenty-two years agone, in the year of grace
      one thousand four hundred and seven, on the selfsame day and at the
      selfsame hour, under yonder porch, nine thousand six hundred and
      thirty-eight persons, without reckoning women and children, trampled each
      other underfoot and perished miserably? An you met the same fate, I should
      never smile again. To see you is to love you, messire; to know you is to
      conceive a sudden and overmastering desire to serve you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Limousin gentleman had halted in no small surprise and turned pale to
      hear such discourse and see the fellow tearing out his hair in fistfuls.
      In his terror he was for turning back the way he had come. But Florent
      Guillaume, on his knees in the mud, held him back by the skirt of his
      jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never go that way, messire! not that way. You might meet Jacquet
      Coquedouille, and you would be all in an instant turned into stone. Better
      encounter the basilisk than Jacquet Coquedouille. I will tell you what you
      must do if, like the wise and prudent man your face proclaims you to be,
      you would live long and make your peace with God. Hearken to me; I am a
      scholar, a Bachelor. To-day the holy relics will be borne through the
      streets and crossways of the city. You will find great solace in touching
      the carven shrines which enclose the cornelian cup wherefrom the child
      Jesus drank, one of the wine-jars of the Marriage at Cana, the cloth of
      the Last Supper, and the holy foreskin. If you take my advice, we will go
      wait for them, under cover, at a cookshop I wot of, before which they will
      pass without fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a wheedling voice, without loosing his hold of the pilgrim&rsquo;s
      jacket, he pointed to the lace-maker and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messire, you must give six sous to yonder worthy woman, that she may go
      buy us wine, for she knows where good liquor is to be gotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Limousin gentleman, who was a simple soul after all, went where he was
      led, and Florent Guillaume supped on the leg and wing of a goose, the
      bones whereof he put in his pocket as a present for Madame Ysabeau, his
      fellow lodger in the timbers of the steeple,&mdash;to wit, Jean Magne the
      bell-ringer&rsquo;s magpie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her that night perched on the beam where she was used to roost,
      beside the hole in the wall which was her storeroom wherein she hoarded
      walnuts and hazel-nuts, almonds and beech-nuts. She had awoke at the noise
      of his coming and flapped her wings; so he greeted her very courteously,
      addressing her in these obliging terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Magpie most pious, lady recluse, bird of the cloister, Margot of the
      Nunnery, sable-frocked Abbess, Church fowl of the lustrous coat, all
      hail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then offering her the goose bones nicely folded in a cabbage leaf:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I bring you here the scraps remaining of a good dinner a
      gentleman from Limoges gave me. His countrymen are radish eaters; but I
      have taught this one to prefer an Anis goose to all the radishes in the
      Limousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day and the rest of the week Florent Guillaume,&mdash;for he could
      never light on his fat friend again nor yet any other good pilgrim with a
      well-lined travelling wallet,&mdash;fasted <i>a solis ortu usque ad
      occasum</i>, from rising sun to dewy eve. Marguerite the lace-maker did
      likewise. This was very meet and right, seeing the time was Holy Week.

    <p>
      Now on Holy Easter Day, Maître Jacquet Coquedouille, a notable citizen of
      the place, was peeping through a hole in a shutter of his house and
      watching the countless throng of pilgrims passing down the steep street.
      They were wending homewards, happy to have won their pardon; and the sight
      of them greatly magnified his veneration for the Black Virgin. For he
      deemed a lady so much sought after must needs be a puissant dame. He was
      old, and his only hope lay in God&rsquo;s mercy. Yet was he but ill-assured of
      his eternal salvation, for he remembered how many a time he had ruthlessly
      fleeced the widow and the orphan. Moreover, he had robbed Florent
      Guillaume of his scrivenry at the sign of Our Lady. He was used to lend at
      high interest on sound security. Yet could no man infer he was a usurer,
      forasmuch as he was a Christian, and it was only the Jews practised usury,&mdash;the
      Jews, and, if you will, the Lombards and the men of Cahors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Jacquet Coquedouille went about the matter quite otherwise than the
      Jews. He never said, like Jacob, Ephraim, and Manasses, &ldquo;I am lending you
      money.&rdquo; What he did say was, &ldquo;I am putting money into your business to
      help your trafficking,&rdquo; a different thing altogether. For usury and
      lending upon interest were forbidden by the Church, but trafficking was
      lawful and permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet at the thought how he had brought many Christian folk to poverty
      and despair, Jacquet Coquedouille felt the pangs of remorse, as he
      pictured the sword of Divine Justice hanging over his head. So on this
      holy Easter Day he was fain to secure him against the Last Judgment by
      winning the protection of Our Lady. He thought to himself she would plead
      for him at the judgment seat of her divine Son, if only he gave her a
      handsome fee. So he went to the great chest where he kept his gold, and,
      after making sure the chamber door was shut fast, he opened the chest,
      which was full of angels, flor-ins, esterlings, nobles, gold crowns, gold
      ducats, and golden sous, and all the coins ever struck by Christian or
      Saracen. He extracted with a sigh of regret twelve deniers of fine gold
      and laid them on the table, which was crowded with balances, files,
      scissors, gold-scales, and account books. After shutting his chest again
      and triple-locking it, he numbered the deniers, renumbered them, gazed
      long at them with looks of affection, and addressed them in words so soft
      and sweet, so affable and ingratiating, so gentle and courteous, it seemed
      rather the music of the spheres than human speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, little angels!&rdquo; sighed the good old man. &ldquo;Oh, my dear little angels!
      Oh, my pretty gold sheep, with the fine, precious fleece!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking the pieces between his fingers with as much reverence as it had
      been the body of Our Lord, he put them in the balance and made sure they
      were of the full weight,&mdash;or very near, albeit a trifle clipped
      already by the Lombards and the Jews, through whose hands they had passed.
      After which he spoke to them yet more graciously than before:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my pretty sheep, my sweet, pretty lambs, there, let me shear you! &lsquo;T
      will do you no hurt at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, seizing his great scissors, he clipped off shreds of gold here and
      there, as he was used to clip every piece of money before parting with it.
      And he gathered the clippings carefully in a wooden bowl that was already
      half full of bits of gold. He was ready to give twelve angels to the Holy
      Virgin; but he felt no way bound to depart from his use and wont. This
      done, he went to the aumry where his pledges lay, and drew out a little
      blue purse, broidered with silver, which a dame of the petty trading sort
      had left with him in her distress. He remembered that blue and white are
      Our Lady&rsquo;s colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day and the next he did nothing further. But in the night, betwixt
      Monday and Tuesday, he had cramps, and dreamt the devils were pulling him
      by the feet. This he took for a warning of God and our Blessed Lady,
      tarried within doors pondering the matter all the day, and then toward
      evening went to lay his offering at the feet of the Black Virgin.

      THAT same day, as night was closing in, Florent Guillaume thought ruefully
      of returning to his airy bedchamber. He had fasted the livelong day, sore
      against the grain, holding that a good Christian ought not to fast in the
      glorious Resurrection week. Before mounting to his bed in the steeple, he
      went to offer a pious prayer to the Lady of Le Puy. She was still there in
      the midst of the Church at the spot where she had offered herself on the
      Grand Friday to the veneration of the Faithful. Small and black, crowned
      with jewels, in a mantle blazing with gold and precious stones and pearls,
      she held on her knees the Child Jesus, who was as black as his mother and
      passed his head through a slit in her cloak. It was the miraculous image
      which St. Louis had received as a gift from the Soldan of Egypt and had
      carried with his own hands to the Church of Anis.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the pilgrims were gone now, and the Church was dark and empty. The
      last offerings of the Faithful were spread at the feet of the beautiful
      Black Virgin, displayed on a table lit with wax tapers. You could see
      amongst the rest a head, hearts, hands, feet, a woman&rsquo;s breasts of silver,
      a little boat of gold, eggs, loaves, Aurillac cheeses, and in a bowl full
      of deniers, sous, and groats, a little blue purse broidered with silver.
      Over against the table, in a huge chair, dozed the priest who guarded the
      offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Florent Guillaume dropped on his knees before the holy image, and said
      over to himself this pious prayer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, an it be true that the holy prophet Jeremias, having beheld thee
      with the eyes of faith ere ever thou wast conceived, carved with his hands
      out of cedar-wood in thy likeness the holy image before which I am at this
      present kneeling; an it be true that afterward King Ptolemy, instructed of
      the miracles wrought by this same holy image, took it from the Jewish
      priests, bare it to Egypt and set it up, covered with precious stones, in
      the temple of the idols; an it be true that Nebuchadnezzar, conqueror of
      the Egyptians, seized it in his turn and had it laid amongst his treasure,
      where the Saracens found it when they captured Babylon; an it be true that
      the Soldan loved it in his heart above all things, and was used to adore
      it at the least once every day; an it be true that the said Soldan had
      never given it to our saintly King Louis, but that his wife, who was a
      Saracen dame, yet prized chivalry and knightly prowess, resolved to make
      it a gift to the best knight and worthiest champion of all Christendom; in
      a word, an this image be miraculous, as I do firmly credit, have it do a
      miracle, Lady, in favour of the poor clerk who hath many a time writ thy
      praises on the vellum of the service books. He hath sanctified his sinful
      hands by engrossing in a fair writing, with great red capitals at the
      beginning of each clause, &lsquo;the fifteen joys of Our Lady,&rsquo; in the vulgar
      tongue and in rhyme, for the comforting of the afflicted. &lsquo;Tis pious work
      this. Think of it, Lady, and heed not his sins. Give him somewhat to eat.
      &lsquo;Twill both do me much profit, and bring thee great honour, for the
      miracle will appear no mean one to all them that know the world. Thou hast
      this day gotten gold, eggs, cheeses, and a little blue purse broidered
      with silver. Lady, I grudge thee none of the gifts that have been made
      thee. Thou dost well deserve them, yea, and more than they. I do not so
      much as ask thee to make them give me back what a thief hath robbed me of,
      a thief by name Jacquet Coque-douille, one of the most honoured citizens
      of this thy town of Le Puy. No, all I ask of thee is not to let me die of
      hunger. And if thou grant me this boon, I will indite a full and fair
      history of thine holy image here present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So prayed Florent Guillaume. The soft murmur of his petition was answered
      only by the deep-chested, placid snore of the sleeping priest. The poor
      scrivener rose from his knees, stepped noiselessly adown the nave, for he
      was grown so light his footfall could scarce be heard, and, fasting as he
      was, climbed the tower stairs that had as many steps as there are days in
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Madame Ysabeau, slipping under the cloister gate, entered her
      Church. The pilgrims had driven her away, for she loved peace and
      solitude. The bird came forward cautiously, putting one foot slowly in
      front of the other, then stopped and craned her neck, casting a suspicious
      look to right and left. Then giving a graceful little jump and shaking out
      her tail feathers, she hopped up to the Black Madonna. Then she stood
      stock still a few moments, scrutinising the sleeping watchman and
      questioning the darkness and silence with eyes and ears alert. At last
      with a mighty flutter of wings she alighted on the table of offerings.

      MEANWHILE Florent Guillaume had settled himself for the night in the
      steeple. It was bitter cold. The wind came blowing in through the
      luffer-boards and fluted and organed among the bells to rejoice the heart
      of the cats and owls. And this was not the only objection to the lodging.
      Since the earthquake of 1427, which had shaken the whole church, the spire
      was dropping to pieces stone by stone and threatened to collapse
      altogether in the first storm. Our Lady suffered this dilapidation because
      of the people&rsquo;s sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Florent Guillaume fell asleep, which is a token of his innocency
      of heart. What dreams he dreamt is clean forgot, except that he had a
      vision in his sleep of a lady of consummate beauty who came and kissed him
      on the mouth. But when his lips opened to return her salute, he swallowed
      two or three woodlice that were walking over his face and by their
      tickling had deluded his sleeping senses into the agreeable fancy. He
      awoke, and hearing a noise of wings beating above his head, he thought it
      was a devil, as was very natural for him to opine, seeing how the evil
      spirits flock in countless swarms to torment mankind, and above all at
      night time. But the moon just then breaking through the clouds, he
      recognised Madame Ysabeau and saw she was busy with her beak pushing into
      a crack in the wall that served her for storehouse a blue purse broidered
      with silver. He let her do as she list; but when she had left her hoard,
      he clambered onto a beam, took the purse, opened it, and saw it contained
      twelve good gold deniers, which he clapped in his belt, giving thanks to
      the incomparable Black Virgin of Le Puy. For he was a clerk and versed in
      the Scriptures, and he remembered how the Lord fed his prophet Elias by a
      raven; whence he inferred that the Holy Mother of God had sent by a magpie
      twelve deniers to her poor penman, Florent Guillaume.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow Florent and Marguerite the lace-maker ate a dish of tripe,&mdash;a
      treat they had craved for many a long year.
    </p>
    <p>
      So ends the Miracle of the Magpie. May he who tells the tale live, as he
      would fain live, in good and gentle peace, and all good hap befall such
      folk as shall read the same.

      THE Parisians were far from loving the English and found it hard to put up
      with them. When, after the obsequies of the late King Charles VI, the Duke
      of Bedford had the sword of the King of France borne before him, the
      people murmured. But what cannot be cured must be endured. Besides, though
      the capital hated the English, it loved the Burgundians. What more natural
      for citizen folk, and especially for money-changers and traders, than to
      admire Duke Philip, a prince of seemly presence and the richest nobleman
      in Christendom. As for the &ldquo;little King of Bourges,&rdquo; a sorry-looking
      mortal and very poor, strongly suspected, moreover, of foul murder at the
      Bridge of Montereau, what had he about him to please folk withal? Scorn
      was the sentiment felt for him, and horror and loathing for his partisans.
      For ten years now had these been riding and raiding around the walls,
      pillaging and holding to ransom. No doubt the English and Burgun-dians did
      much the same; when, in the month of August, 1423, Duke Philip came to
      Paris, his men-at-arms had ravaged all the country about. And they were
      friends and allies of course; but after all they only came and went. The
      Armagnacs, on the contrary, were always in the field, stealing whatever
      they could lay their hands upon, firing farmsteads and churches, killing
      women and children, deflowering virgins and nuns, hanging men by the
      thumbs. In 1420 they threw themselves like devils let loose on the village
      of Champigny and burnt up altogether oats, wheat, lambs, cows, oxen,
      children, and women. They did the like and worse at Croissy. A very great
      clerk of the University declared they wrought all wickedness that can be
      wrought and conceived, and that more Christian folk had been martyred at
      their hands than ever Maximian or Diocletian did to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the news that these accursed Armagnacs were at the gates of Compiègne
      and occupying the neighbouring castles and their lands, the folk of Paris
      were sore afraid. They believed that the Dauphin&rsquo;s soldiers had sworn, if
      they entered Paris, to slay whomsoever they found there. They affirmed
      openly that Messire Charles de Valois had given up to his men&rsquo;s mercy town
      and townsmen, great and small, of every rank and condition, men and women,
      and that he proposed to drive the plough over the site of the city. The
      inhabitants mostly believed the tale; so they set the St. Andrew&rsquo;s cross
      on their coats, in token that they were of the party of the Burgundians.
      Their hatred was doubled, and their fears with it, when they learned that
      Brother Richard and the Maid Jeanne were at the head of King Charles&rsquo; 
      army. They knew nothing of the Maid save from the rumour of the victories
      she was reported to have won at Orleans. But they deemed she had
      vanquished the English by the Devil&rsquo;s aid, by means of spells and
      enchantments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Masters of the University all said: &ldquo;A creature in shape of a woman is
      with the Armagnacs. What it is, God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Brother Richard, they knew him well. He had come to Paris before, and
      they had hearkened reverently to his sermons. He had even persuaded them
      to renounce those games of chance for which they had been used to forget
      meat and drink and the services of the Church. Now, at the tidings that
      Brother Richard was on foray with the Armagnacs and winning over for them
      by his well-hung tongue good towns like Troyes in Champagne, they called
      down on him the curse of God and his Saints. They tore out of their hats
      the leaden medals inscribed with the holy name of Jesus, which the good
      Brother had given them, and to show in what detestation they held him,
      resumed dice, bowls, draughts, and all other games they had renounced at
      his exhortation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was strongly fortified, for in the days when King Jean was a
      prisoner of the English, the citizens of Paris, seeing the enemy in the
      heart of the Kingdom, had feared a siege and had hastened to put the walls
      in a state of defence. They had surrounded the place with moats and
      counter-moats. The moats, on the left bank of the river, were dug at the
      foot of the walls forming the old circle of fortification. But on the
      right bank there were faubourgs, both extensive and well built, outside
      the walls and almost touching them. The new moats enclosed a part of
      these, and the Dauphin Charles, King Jean&rsquo;s son, afterward had a wall
      built along the line of them. Nevertheless there was some feeling of
      insecurity, for the Cathedral Chapter took measures to put the relics and
      treasure out of reach of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, on Sunday, August 21st, a Cordelier, by name Brother Joconde,
      entered the town. He had made pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and was said, like
      Brother Vincent Ferrier and Brother Bernardino of Sienna, to have enjoyed
      by the abounding grace of God many revelations anent the forthcoming end
      of the world. He gave out that he would preach his first sermon to the
      Parisians on Tuesday following, St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, in the Cloister of
      &ldquo;The Innocents.&rdquo; On the eve of that day more than six thousand persons
      spent the night in the Cloister. At the foot of the platform wherefrom he
      was to preach, the women sat squatted on their heels, and amongst them
      Guillaumette Dyonis, who was blind from birth. She was the child of an
      artisan who had been killed by the Burgundians in the woods of
      Boulogne-la-Grande. Her mother had been carried off by a Burgundian
      man-at-arms, and none knew what had become of her. Guillaumette was
      fifteen or sixteen years of age. She lived at &ldquo;The Innocents&rdquo; on what she
      made by spinning wool, at which trade there was not a better worker to be
      found in all the town. She went and came in the streets without the help
      of any and knew everything as well as those who can see. As she lived a
      good and holy life and fasted often, she was favoured with visions. In
      especial she had been accorded notable revelations by the Apostle St. John
      concerning the troubles that then beset the Kingdom of France. Now, as she
      was reciting her Hours at the foot of the platform, under the great Dance
      of Death, a woman called Simone la Bardine, who was seated on the ground
      beside her, asked her if the good Brother was not coming soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guillaumette Dyonis could not see the tailed gown of green and the horned
      wimple which Simone la Bardine wore; yet she knew by instinct the woman
      was no honest dame. She felt a natural aversion for light women and the
      sort the soldiers called their sweethearts or &ldquo;doxies,&rdquo; but it had been
      revealed to her that we should hold such in great pity and deal
      compassionately with them. Wherefore she answered Simone la Bardine
      gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good Father will come soon, please God. And we shall have no reason
      to regret having waited, for he is eloquent in prayer and his sermons turn
      the folk to devotion more even than those of Brother Richard, who spake in
      these Cloisters in the springtime. He knows more than any man living of
      the times that shall come and shall show us strange portents. I trow we
      shall gain great profit of his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant it,&rdquo; sighed Simone la Bardine. &ldquo;But are you not very sorry to
      be blind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I wait to see God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simone la Bardine made her mantle into a cushion, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is all ups and downs. I live at the top of the Rue Saint-Antoine. &lsquo;T
      is the finest part of the city and the merriest, for the best hostelries
      are in the Place Baudet and thereabout. Before the Wars there was aye
      abundance there of hot cakes and fresh herrings and Auxerre wine by the
      tun. With the English famine entered the town. Now is there neither bread
      in the bin nor firewood on the hearth. One after other the Armagnacs and
      the Burgundians have drunk up all the wine, and there is naught left in
      the cellar but a little thin, sour cider and sloe-juice. Knights armed for
      the tourney, pilgrims with their cockleshells and staves, traders with
      their chests full of knives and little service-books, where are they gone?
      They never come now to seek a lodging and good living in the Rue
      Saint-Antoine. But the wolves quit covert in the forests and prowl of
      nights in the faubourgs and devour little children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your trust in God,&rdquo; Guillaumette Dyonis answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; returned Simone la Bardine. &ldquo;But I have not told you the worst. On
      the Thursday before St, John&rsquo;s day, at three after midnight, two
      Englishmen came knocking at my door. Not knowing but they had come to rob
      me or break up my chests and coffers out of mischief, or do some other
      devilment, I shouted to them from my window to go their ways, that I did
      not know them and I was not going to open the door. But they only hammered
      louder, swearing they were going to break in the door and come in and cut
      off my nose and ears. To stop their uproar I emptied a crockful of water
      on their heads; but the crock slipped out of my hands and broke on the
      back of one fellow&rsquo;s neck so unchancily that it felled him. His comrade
      called up the watch. I was haled to the Châtelet and clapped in prison,
      where I was very hardly handled, and only escaped by paying a heavy sum of
      money. I found my house pillaged from cellar to attic. From that day my
      affairs have gone from bad to worse, and I have naught in the wide world
      but the clothes I stand up in. In very despair I have come hither to hear
      the good Father, who they say abounds in comforting words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, who loves you,&rdquo; said Guillaumctte Dyonis, &ldquo;has moved you in all
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a great silence fell on the crowd as Brother Joconde appeared. His
      eyes flashed like lightning. When he opened his lips, his voice pealed out
      like thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come from Jerusalem,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;and to prove it, see in this
      wallet are roses of Jericho, a branch of the olive under which Our Saviour
      sweated drops of blood, and a handful of the earth of Calvary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a long narrative of his pilgrimage. And he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Syria I met Jews travelling in companies; I asked them whither they
      were bound, and they told me: &lsquo;We are flocking in crowds to Babylon,
      because in very deed the Messiah is born among men, and will restore us
      our heritage, and stablish us again in the Land of Promise.&rsquo; So said these
      Jews of Syria. Now the Scriptures teach us that he they call the Messiah
      is, in truth, Antichrist, of whom it is said he must be born at Babylon,
      chief city of the kingdom of Persia, be reared at Bethsaida, and dwell in
      his youth at Chorazin. That is why Our Lord said: &lsquo;Woe unto thee,
      Chor-azin! Woe unto thee, Bethsaida!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The year that is at hand,&rdquo; went on Brother Joconde, &ldquo;will bring the
      greatest marvels that have ever been beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The times are at hand. He is born, the man of sin, the son of perdition,
      the wicked man, the beast from out the abyss, the abomination of
      desolation. He comes from the tribe of Dan, of which it is written: &lsquo;Dan
      shall be a serpent in the way, an adder in the path.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren, soon shall ye see returning to this earth the Prophets Elias
      and Enoch, Moses, Jeremias, and St. John Evangelist. And lo! the day of
      wrath is dawning, the day which &lsquo;solvet sæclum in favilla, teste David et
      Sibylla.&rsquo; Wherefore now is the time to repent and do penance and renounce
      the false delights of this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the good Brother&rsquo;s word bosoms heaved with remorse and deep-drawn sighs
      were heard. Not a few, both men and women, were near fainting when the
      preacher cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read in your souls that ye keep mandrakes at home, which will bring you
      to hell fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Many Parisians paid heavily to the old witch-wives, who
      profess unholy knowledge, for to buy mandrakes, and were used to keep them
      treasured in a chest. These magic roots have the likeness of a little man,
      hideously ugly and misshapen in a weird and diabolic fashion. They would
      dress them out magnificently, in fine linen and silks, and the mannikins
      brought them riches, chief source of all the ills of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Brother Joconde thundered against women&rsquo;s extravagant attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave off,&rdquo; he bade them, &ldquo;your horns and your tails! Are ye not shamed
      so to bedizen yourselves like she-devils? Light bonfires, I say, in the
      public streets, and cast therein and burn your damnable head-gear,&mdash;pads
      and rolls, erections of leather and whalebone, wherewith ye stiffen out
      the front of your hoods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ended by exhorting them with so much zeal and loving-kindness not to
      lose their souls, but put themselves in the grace of God, that all who
      heard him wept hot tears. And Simone la Bardine wept more abundantly than
      any.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, finally, coming down from his platform, Brother Joconde crossed the
      cloister and graveyard, the people fell on their knees as he went by. The
      women gave him their little ones to bless, or besought him to touch medals
      and rosaries for them. Some plucked threads from his gown, thinking to get
      healing by putting them, like relics of the Saints, on the places where
      they were afflicted. Guillaumette Dyonis followed the good Father as
      easily as if she saw him with her bodily eyes. Simone la Bardine trailed
      behind her, sobbing. She had pulled off her horned wimple and tied a
      kerchief round her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they marched, the three of them, along the streets, where men and
      women, who had been at the preaching, were kindling fires before their
      doors to cast therein head-gear and mandrake roots. But on reaching the
      river bank, Brother Joconde sat down under an elm, and Guillaumette Dyonis
      came up to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, it hath been revealed to me in vision that you are come to this
      Kingdom to restore the same to good peace and concord. I have had myself
      many revelations concerning the peace of the Kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next Simone la Bardine took up her parable and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Joconde, I lived once in a fine house in the Rue Saint-Antoine,
      near by the Place Baudet, which is the fairest quarter of Paris, and the
      wealthiest. I had a matted chamber, mantles of cloth of gold, and gowns
      trimmed with miniver, enough to fill three great chests; I had a
      feather-bed, a dresser loaded with pewter, and a little book wherein you
      saw in pictures the story of Our Lord. But since the wars and pillagings
      that devastate the Kingdom, I have lost everything. The gallants never
      come now to take their pleasure in the Place Baudet. But the wolves come
      there instead to devour little children. The Burgundians and the English
      are as bad as the Armagnacs. Would you have me go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Monk gazed a while in silence at the two women; and deeming it was
      Jesus Christ himself had led them to him, he received them for his
      Penitents, and thereafter the twain followed him wherever he went. Every
      day he preached to the people, now at &ldquo;The Innocents,&rdquo; now at the Porte
      Saint-Honoré, or at the Halles. But he never went outside the Walls, by
      reason of the Armagnacs, who were raiding all the countryside round the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      His words led many souls to a better life; and at the fourth sermon he
      preached in Paris, he received for Penitents Jeannette Chastenier, wife of
      a merchant-draper on the Pont-au-Change, and another woman, by name
      Opportune Jadoin, who nursed the sick at the Hôtel-Dieu and was no longer
      very young. He admitted likewise into his company a gardener of the
      Ville-l&rsquo;Evêque, a lad of about sixteen, Robin by name, who bare on his
      feet and hands the stigmata of the crucifixion, and was shaken by a sore
      trembling of all his limbs. He often saw the Holy Virgin in corporeal
      presence, and heard her speech and savoured the divine odours of her
      glorified body. She had entrusted him with a message for the Regent of
      England and for the Duke of Burgundy. Meantime the army of Messire Charles
      of Valois entered the town of Saint-Denis. And no man durst from that day
      go out of Paris to harvest the fields or gather aught from the
      market-gardens which covered the plain to the northward of the city.
      Instantly famine prices ruled, and the inhabitants began to suffer
      cruelly. And they were further exasperated because they believed
      themselves betrayed. It was openly said that certain folk, and in especial
      certain men of Religion, suborned by Messire Charles of Valois, were
      watching for the best time to stir up trouble and bring in the enemy in an
      hour of panic and confusion. Haunted by this fear, which was not perhaps
      altogether baseless, the citizens who kept guard of the ramparts showed
      scant mercy to any men of evil looks whom they found loitering near the
      Gates and whom they might suspect, on the most trivial evidence, of making
      signals to the Armagnacs. On Thursday, September 8th, the good people of
      Paris awoke without any fear of being attacked before the next day. This
      day, September 8th, was the Feast of the Nativity of the Virgin, and it
      was an established custom with the two factions that tore the Kingdom in
      twain to keep holy the feast-days of Our Lord and His Blessed Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet at this holy season the Parisians, on coming forth from Mass, learnt
      that, notwithstanding the sacredness of the day, the Armagnacs had
      appeared before the Porte Saint-Honoré and had set fire to the outwork
      which defended its approach. It was further reported that Messire Charles
      of Valois was posted, for the time being, along with Brother Richard and
      the Maid Jeanne, in the Hog Market without the Walls. The same afternoon,
      through all the city, on either side the bridges, shouts of fear arose&mdash;&ldquo;Save
      yourselves! fly, the enemy are come in, all is lost!&rdquo; The cries were heard
      even inside the Churches, where pious folks were singing Vespers. These
      came flying out in terror and ran to their houses to take refuge behind
      barred doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the men who went about raising these cries were emissaries of Messire
      Charles of Valois. In fact, at that very time, the Company of the Maréchal
      de Rais was making assault on the Walls near by the Porte Saint-Honoré.
      The Armagnacs had brought up in carts great bundles of faggots and wattled
      hurdles to fill up the moats, and above six hundred scaling-ladders for
      storming the ramparts. The Maid Jeanne, who was nowise as the Burgundians
      believed, but lived a pious life and guarded her chastity, set foot to
      ground, and was the first down into a dry moat, which for that cause was
      easy to cross. But thereupon they found themselves exposed to the arrows
      and cross-bolts that rained down thick and fast from the Walls. Then they
      had in front of them a second moat. Wherefore were the Maid and her
      men-at-arms sore hampered. Jeanne sounded the great moat with her lance
      and shouted to throw in faggots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the town could be heard the roar of cannon, and all along the
      streets the citizens were running, half accoutred, to their posts on the
      ramparts, knocking over as they went the brats playing about in the
      gutters. The chains were drawn across the roadways, and barricades were
      begun. Tribulation and tumult filled all the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither the Brother Joconde nor his Penitents saw aught of it,
      forasmuch as they took heed only of eternal things, and deemed the vain
      agitation of men to be but a foolish game. They marched through the
      streets singing the &ldquo;Veni creator spiritus,&rdquo; and crying out: &ldquo;Pray, for
      the times are at hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they made their way in good array down the Rue Saint-Antoine, which
      was densely crowded with men, women, and children. Coming presently to the
      Place Baudet, Brother Joconde pushed through the throng and mounted a
      great stone that stood at the door of the Hôtel de la Truie, which Messire
      Florimont Lecocq, the master of the house, used to help him mount his
      mule. This Messire Florimont Lecocq was Sergeant at the Châtelet Prison
      and a partisan of the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, standing on the great stone, Brother Joconde preached to the people.
      &ldquo;Sow ye,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;sow ye, good folk; sow abundantly of beans, for He
      which is to come will come quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the beans they were to sow, the good Brother signified the charitable
      works it behoved them accomplish before Our Lord should come, in the
      clouds of heaven, to judge both the quick and the dead. And it was urgent
      to sow these works without tarrying, for that the harvest would be soon.
      Guillaumette Dyonis, Simone la Bardine, Jeanne Chastenier, Opportune
      Jadoin, and Robin the gardener, stood in a ring about the Preacher, and
      cried &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the citizens, who thronged behind in a great crowd, pricked up their
      ears and bent their brows, thinking the Monk was foretelling the entry of
      Charles of Valois into his good town of Paris, over which he was fain&mdash;at
      any rate, so they believed&mdash;to drive the ploughshare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the good Brother went on with his soul-awakening discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! ye men of Paris, ye are worse than the Pagans of old Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the mangonels firing from the Porte Saint-Denis mingled their
      thunder with Brother Joconde&rsquo;s voice and shook the bystanders&rsquo; hearts
      within them. Some one in the press cried out, &ldquo;Death! death to traitors!&rdquo;
       All this time Messire Florimont Lecocq was within-doors doing on his
      armour. He now came forth at the noise, before he had buckled his
      leg-pieces. Seeing the Monk standing on his mounting-block, he asked:
      &ldquo;What is this good Father saying?&rdquo; And a chorus of voices answered:
      &ldquo;Telling us that Messire Charles of Valois is going to enter the city,&rdquo;
       while others cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is against the folk of Paris,&rdquo; and others again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would fain cozen and betray us, like the Brother Richard, who at this
      very time is riding with our enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Brother Joconde made answer: &ldquo;There be neither Armagnacs, nor
      Burgundians, nor French, nor English, but only the sons of light and the
      sons of darkness. Ye are lewd fellows and your women wantons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to, thou apostate! thou sorcerer! thou traitor!&rdquo; yelled Messire
      Florimont Lecocq,&mdash;and lugging out his sword, he plunged it in the
      good Brother&rsquo;s bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With pale lips and faltering voice, the man of God still managed to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray, fast, do penance, and ye shall be forgiven, my brethren...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his voice choked, as the blood poured from his mouth, and he fell on
      the stones. Two knights, Sir John Stewart and Sir George Morris, threw
      themselves on the body and pierced it with more than a hundred dagger
      thrusts, vociferating:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long life to King Henry! Long life to my Lord the Duke of Bedford! Down
      with the Dauphin! Down with the mad Maid of the Armagnacs! Up, up! To the
      Gates, to the Gates!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith they ran to the Walls, drawing off with them Messire Florimont
      and the crowd of citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the holy women and the gardener tarried about the bleeding
      corse. Simone la Bardine lay prostrate on the ground, kissing the good
      Brother&rsquo;s feet and wiping away his blood with her unbound hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Guillaumette Dyonis, standing up with her arms lifted to heaven, cried
      in a voice as clear as the sound of bells:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sisters, Jeanne, Opportune and Simone, and you, my brother, Robin the
      gardener, let us be going, for the times are at hand. The soul of this
      good Father holds me by the hand, and it will lead me aright. Wherefore ye
      must follow along with me. And we will say to those who are making cruel
      war upon each other: &lsquo;Kiss and make peace. And if ye must needs use your
      arms, take up the cross and go forth all together to fight the Saracens.&rsquo; 
      Come! my sisters and my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeanne Chastenier picked up the shaft of an arrow from the ground, brake
      it, and made a cross, which she laid on good Brother Joconde&rsquo;s bosom. Then
      these holy women, and the gardener with them, followed after Guillaumette
      Dyonis, who led them by the streets and squares and alleys as if her eyes
      had seen the light of day. They reached the foot of the rampart, and by
      the stairway of a tower that was left unguarded, they mounted onto the
      curtain-wall. There had been no time to furnish it with its hoardings of
      wood; so they went along in the open. They proceeded toward the Porte
      Saint-Honoré, by this time enveloped in clouds of dust and smoke. It was
      there the Maréchal de Rais and his men were making assault. Their bolts
      flew thick and fast against the ramparts, and they were hurling faggots
      into the water of the great moat. On the hog&rsquo;s-back parting the great moat
      from the little, stood the Maid, crying: &ldquo;Yield, yield you to the King of
      France.&rdquo; The English had abandoned the top of the wall in terror, leaving
      their dead and wounded behind them. Guillaumette Dyonis walked first, her
      head high and her left arm extended before her, while with her right hand
      she kept signing herself reverently. Simone la Bardine followed close on
      her heels. Then came Jeanne Chastenier and Opportune Jadoin. Robin the
      gardener brought up the rear, his body all shaking with his infirmity, and
      showing the divine stigmata on his hands. They were singing canticles as
      they walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Guillaumette, turning now toward the city and now toward the open
      country, cried: &ldquo;Brethren, embrace ye one another. Live in peace and
      harmony. Take the iron of your spearheads and forge it into ploughshares!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had she spoken ere a shower of arrows, some from the parapet-way
      where a Company of Citizens was defiling, some from the hog&rsquo;s-back where
      the Armagnac men-at-arms were massed, flew in her direction, and therewith
      a storm of insults:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanton! traitress! witch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she went on exhorting the two sides to stablish the Kingdom of
      Jesus Christ upon earth and to live in innocency and brotherly love, till
      a cross-bow bolt struck her in the throat and she staggered and fell
      backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was which could laugh the louder at this, Armagnacs or Burgundians.
      Drawing her gown over her feet, she lay still and made no other stir, but
      gave up her soul, sighing the name of Jesus. Her eyes, which remained
      open, glowed like two opals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Short while after the death of Guillaumette Dyonis the men of Paris
      returned in great force to man their Wall, and defended their city right
      valorously. Jeanne the Maid was wounded by a cross-bow bolt in the leg,
      and Messire Charles of Valois&rsquo; men-at-arms fell back upon the Chapelle
      Saint-Denis. What became of Jeanne Chastenier and Opportune Jadoin no one
      knows. They were never heard of more. Simone la Bardine and Robin the
      gardener were taken the same day by the citizens on guard at the Walls and
      handed over to the Bishop&rsquo;s officer, who duly brought them before the
      Courts. The Church adjudged Simone heretic, and condemned her for salutary
      penance to the bread of suffering and the water of affliction. Robin was
      convicted of sorcery, and, persevering in his error, was burned alive in
      the Place du Parvis.

    <p>
      ONE day the Capuchin, Brother Jean Chavaray, meeting my good master the
      Abbé Coign-ard in the cloister of &ldquo;The Innocents,&rdquo; fell into talk with him
      of the Brother Olivier Maillard, whose sermons, edifying and macaronic, he
      had lately been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are good bits to be found in these sermons,&rdquo; said the Capuchin,
      &ldquo;notably the tale of the five ladies and the go-between...&rdquo; You will
      readily understand that Brother Olivier, who lived in the reign of Louis
      XI and whose language smacks of the coarseness of that age, uses a
      different word. But our century demands a certain politeness and decency
      in speech; wherefore I employ the term I have, to wit, <i>go-between</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; replied my good master, &ldquo;to signify by the expression a woman
      who is so obliging as to play intermediary in matters of love and
      love-making. The Latin has several names for her,&mdash;as <i>lena,
      conciliatrix</i>, also <i>internuntia libidinum</i>, ambassadress of
      naughty desires. These prudish dames perform the best of services; but
      seeing they busy themselves therein for money, we distrust their
      disinterestedness. Call yours a <i>procuress</i>, good Father, and have
      done with it; &lsquo;t is a word in common use, and has a not unseemly sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I will, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé,&rdquo; assented Brother Jean Chavaray. &ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t
      say <i>mine</i>, I pray, but the Brother Olivier&rsquo;s. A procuress then, who
      lived on the Pont des Tournelles, was visited one day by a knight, who put
      a ring into her hands. &lsquo;It is of fine gold,&rsquo; he told her, &lsquo;and hath a
      balass ruby mounted in the bezel. An you know any dames of good estate, go
      say to the most comely of them that the ring is hers if she is willing to
      come to see me and do at my pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The procuress knew, by having seen them at Mass, five ladies of an
      excellent beauty,&mdash;natives the first of Picardy, the second of
      Poitou, the third of Touraine, another from the good city of Lyons, and
      the last a Parisian, all dwelling in the Cite or its near neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knocked first at the Picard lady&rsquo;s door. A maid opened, but her
      mistress refused to have one word to say to her visitor. She was an honest
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The procuress went next to see the lady of Poitiers and solicit her
      favours for the gallant knight. This dame answered her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Prithee, go tell him who sent you that he is come to the wrong house,
      and that I am not the woman he takes me for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She too is an honest woman; yet less honest than the first, in that she
      tried to appear more so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The procuress then went to see the lady from Tours, made the same offer
      to her as to the other, and showed her the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo; faith,&rsquo; said the lady, &lsquo;but the ring is right lovely.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;T is yours, an you will have it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will not have it at the price you set on it. My husband might catch
      me, and I should be doing him a grief he doth not deserve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lady of Touraine is a harlot, I trow, at bottom of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The procuress left her and went straight to the dame of Lyons, who cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Alack! my good friend, my husband is a jealous wight, and he would cut
      the nose off my face to hinder me winning any more rings at this pretty
      tilting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This dame of Lyons, I tell you, is a worthless good-for-naught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last of all the procuress hurried to the Parisian&rsquo;s. She was a hussy, and
      answered brazenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;My husband goes Wednesday to his vineyards; tell the good sir who sent
      you I will come that day and see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such, according to Brother Olivier, from Picardy to Paris, are the
      degrees from good to evil amongst women. What think you of the matter,
      Monsieur Coignard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which my good master made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is a shrewd matter to consider the acts and impulses of these petty
      creatures in their relations with Eternal Justice. I have no lights
      thereanent. But methinks the Lyons dame who feared having her nose cut off
      was a more good-for-nothing baggage than the Parisian who was afraid of
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am far, very far, from allowing it,&rdquo; replied Brother Jean Chavaray. &ldquo;A
      woman who fears her husband may come to fear hell fire. Her Confessor, it
      may be, will bring her to do penance and give alms. For, after all, that
      is the end we must come at. But what can a poor Capuchin hope to get of a
      woman whom <i>nothing</i> terrifies?&rdquo;

      IN the days of King Louis XI there lived at Paris, in a matted chamber, a
      citizen dame called Violante, who was comely and well-liking in all her
      person. She had so bright a face that Master Jacques Tribouillard, doctor
      in law and a renowned cosmographer, who was often a visitor at her house,
      was used to tell her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing you, madame, I deem credible and even hold it proven, what
      Cucurbitus Piger lays down in one of his scholia on Strabo, to wit, that
      the famous city and university of Paris was of old known by the name of
      Lutetia or Leucecia, or some such like word coming from <i>Leukê</i>, that
      is to say, &lsquo;the white,&rsquo; forasmuch as the ladies of the same had bosoms
      white as snow,&mdash;yet not so clear and bright and white as is your own,
      madame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which Violante would say in answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T is enough for me if my bosom is not fit to fright folks, like some I
      wot of. And, if I show it, why, &lsquo;tis to follow the fashion. I have not the
      hardihood to do otherwise than the rest of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Madame Violante had been wedded, in the flower of her youth, to an
      Advocate of the Parlement, a man of a harsh temper and sorely set on the
      arraignment and punishing of unfortunate prisoners. For the rest, he was
      of sickly habit and a weakling, of such a sort he seemed more fit to give
      pain to folks outside his doors than pleasure to his wife within. The old
      fellow thought more of his blue bags than of his better half, though these
      were far otherwise shapen, being bulgy and fat and formless. But the
      lawyer spent his nights over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Violante was too reasonable a woman to love a husband that was so
      unlovable. Master Jacques Tribouillard upheld she was a good wife, as
      steadfastly and surely confirmed and stablished in conjugal virtue as
      Lucretia the Roman. And for proof he alleged that he had altogether failed
      to turn her aside from the path of honour. The judicious observed a
      prudent silence on the point, holding that what is hid will only be made
      manifest at the last Judgment Day. They noted how the lady was over fond
      of gewgaws and laces and wore in company and at church gowns of velvet and
      silk and cloth of gold, purfled with miniver; but they were too
      fair-minded folk to decide whether, damning as she did Christian men who
      saw her so comely and so finely dressed to the torments of vain longing,
      she was not damning her own soul too with one of them. In a word, they
      were well ready to stake Madame Violante&rsquo;s virtue on the toss of a coin,
      cross or pile,&mdash;which is greatly to the honour of that fair lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is her Confessor, Brother Jean Turelure, was for ever upbraiding
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think you, madame,&rdquo; he would ask her, &ldquo;that the blessed St. Catherine won
      heaven by leading such a life as yours, baring her bosom and sending to
      Genoa for lace ruffles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was a great preacher, very severe on human weaknesses, who could
      condone naught and thought he had done everything when he had inspired
      terror. He threatened her with hell fire for having washed her face with
      ass&rsquo;s milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a fact, no one could say if she had given her old husband a meet and
      proper head-dress, and Messire Philippe de Coetquis used to warn the
      honest dame in a merry vein:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See to it, I say! He is bald, he will catch his death of cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Messire Philippe de Coetquis was a knight of gallant bearing, as handsome
      as the knave of hearts in the noble game of cards. He had first
      encountered Madame Violante one evening at a ball, and after dancing with
      her far into the night, had carried her home on his crupper, while the
      Advocate splashed his way through the mud and mire of the kennels by the
      dancing light of the torches his four tipsy lackeys bore. In the course of
      these merry doings, a-foot and on horseback, Messire Philippe de Coetquis
      had formed a shrewd notion that Madame Violante had a limber waist and a
      full, firm bosom of her own, and there and then had been smit by her
      charms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a frank and guileless wight and made bold to tell her outright what
      he would have of her,&mdash;to wit, to hold her naked in his two arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which she would make answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messire Philippe, you know not what you say. I am a virtuous wife,&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Or another time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messire Philippe, come back again tomorrow,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when he came next day she would ask innocently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, where is the hurry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These never-ending postponements caused the Chevalier no little distress
      and chagrin. He was ready to believe, with Master Tribouillard, that
      Madame Violante was indeed a Lucretia, so true is it that all men are
      alike in fatuous self-conceit! And we are bound to say she had not so much
      as suffered him to kiss her mouth,&mdash;only a pretty diversion after all
      and a bit of wanton playfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were in this case when Brother Jean Turelure was called to Venice
      by the General of his Order, to preach to sundry Turks lately converted to
      the true Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before setting forth, the good Brother went to take leave of his fair
      Penitent, and upbraided her with more than usual sternness for living a
      dissolute life. He exhorted her urgently to repent and pressed her to wear
      a hair-shirt next her skin,&mdash;an incomparable remedy against naughty
      cravings and a sovran medicine for natures over prone to the sins of the
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She besought him: &ldquo;Good Brother, never ask too much of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he would not hearken, and threatened her with the pains of hell if she
      did not amend her ways. Then he told her he would gladly execute any
      commissions she might be pleased to entrust him with. He was in hopes she
      would beg him to bring her back some consecrated medal, a rosary, or,
      better still, a little of the soil of the Holy Sepulchre which the Turks
      carry from Jerusalem together with dried roses, and which the Italian
      monks sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Violante preferred a quite other request:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Brother, dear Brother, as you are going to Venice, where such
      cunning workmen in this sort are to be found, I pray you bring me back a
      Venetian mirror, the clearest and truest can be gotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Jean Turelure promised to content her wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her Confessor was abroad, Madame Violante led the same life as
      before. And when Messire Philippe pressed her: &ldquo;Were it not well to take
      our pleasure together?&rdquo; she would answer: &ldquo;Nay! &lsquo;t is too hot. Look at the
      weathercock if the wind will not change anon.&rdquo; And the good folk who
      watched her ways were in despair of her ever giving a proper pair of horns
      to her crabbed old husband. &ldquo;&lsquo;T is a sin and a shame!&rdquo; they declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return from Italy Brother Jean Turelure presented himself before
      Madame Violante and told her he had brought what she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, madame,&rdquo; he said, and drew from under his gown a death&rsquo;s-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, madame, is your mirror. This death&rsquo;s-head was given me for that of
      the prettiest woman in all Venice. She was what you are, and you will be
      much like her anon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame Violante, mastering her surprise and horror, answered the good
      Father in a well-assured voice that she understood the lesson he would
      teach her and she would not fail to profit thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall aye have present in my mind, good Brother, the mirror you have
      brought me from Venice, wherein I see my likeness not as I am at present,
      but as doubtless I soon shall be. I promise you to govern my behaviour by
      this salutary thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brother Jean Turelure was far from expecting such pious words. He
      expressed some satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, madame,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;you see yourself the need of altering your
      ways. You promise me henceforth to govern your behaviour by the thought
      this fleshless skull hath brought home to you. Will you not make the same
      promise to God as you have to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked if indeed she must, and he assured her it behoved her so to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will give this promise then,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame, this is very well. There is no going back on your word now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not go back on it, never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having won this binding promise, Brother Jean Turelure left the place,
      radiant with satisfaction. And as he went from the house, he cried out
      loud in the street:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a good work done! By Our Lord God&rsquo;s good help, I have turned and
      set in the way toward the gate of Paradise a lady, who, albeit not sinning
      precisely in the way of fornication spoken of by the Prophet, yet was wont
      to employ for men&rsquo;s temptation the clay whereof the Creator had kneaded
      her that she might serve and adore him withal. She will forsake these
      naughty habits to adopt a better life. I have throughly changed her.
      Praise be to God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the good Brother gone down the stairs when Messire Philippe de
      Coetquis ran up them and scratched at Madame Violante&rsquo;s door. She welcomed
      him with a beaming smile, and led him into a closet, furnished with
      carpets and cushions galore, wherein he had never been admitted before.
      From this he augured well. He offered her sweetmeats he had in a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here be sugar-plums to suck, madame; they are sweet and sugared, but not
      so sweet as your lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which the lady retorted he was a vain, silly fop to make boast of a
      fruit he had never tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her meetly, kissing her forthwith on the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She manifested scarce any annoyance and said only she was an honest woman
      and a true wife. He congratulated her and advised her not to lock up this
      jewel of hers in such close keeping that no man could enjoy it. &ldquo;For, of a
      surety,&rdquo; he swore, &ldquo;you will be robbed of it, and that right soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try then,&rdquo; said she, cuffing him daintily over the ears with her pretty
      pink palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was master by this time to take whatsoever he wished of her. She
      kept protesting with little cries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have it. Fie! fie on you, messire! You must not do it. Oh!
      sweetheart... oh! my love... my life! You are killing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anon, when she had done sighing and dying, she said sweetly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messire Philippe, never flatter yourself you have mastered me by force or
      guile. You have had of me what you craved, but &lsquo;t was of mine own free
      will, and I only resisted so much as was needful that I might yield me as
      I liked best. Sweetheart, I am yours. If, for all your handsome face,
      which I loved from the first, and despite the tenderness of your wooing, I
      did not before grant you what you have just won with my consent, &lsquo;t was
      because I had no true understanding of things. I had no thought of the
      flight of time and the shortness of life and love; plunged in a soft
      languor of indolence, I reaped no harvest of my youth and beauty. However,
      the good Brother Jean Turelure hath given me a profitable lesson. He hath
      taught me the preciousness of the hours. But now he showed me a
      death&rsquo;s-head, saying: &lsquo;Suchlike you will be soon.&rsquo; This taught me we must
      be quick to enjoy the pleasures of love and make the most of the little
      space of time reserved to us for that end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words and the caresses wherewith Madame Violante seconded them
      persuaded Messire Philippe to turn the time to good account, to set to
      work afresh to his own honour and profit and the pleasure and glory of his
      mistress, and to multiply the sure proofs of prowess which it behoves
      every good and loyal servant to give on suchlike an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which, she was ready to cry quits. Taking him by the hand, she
      guided him back to the door, kissed him daintily on the eyes, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart Philippe, is it not well done to follow the precepts of the
      good Brother Jean Turelure?&rdquo;
     </p>

      SATAN lay in his bed with the flaming curtains. The physicians and
      apothecaries of Hell, finding their patient had a white tongue, inferred
      he was suffering from a weakness of the stomach and prescribed a diet at
      once light and nourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satan swore he had no appetite for aught but a certain earthly dish, which
      women excel in making when they meet in company, to wit, tongue-pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctors agreed there was nothing could better suit His Majesty&rsquo;s
      stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour&rsquo;s time the dish was set before the King; but he found it
      insipid and tasteless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent for his Head Cook and asked him where the pie came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Paris, sire. It is quite fresh; &lsquo;twas baked this very morning, in
      the Marais Quarter, by a dozen gossips gathered round the bed at a woman&rsquo;s
      lying-in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now I know the reason it is so flavourless,&rdquo; returned the Prince of
      Darkness. &ldquo;You have not been to the best cooks for dishes of the sort.
      Citizens&rsquo; wives, they do their best; but they lack delicacy, they lack the
      fine touch of genius. Women of the people are clumsier still. For a real

     THE WHICH WAS SHOWED IN A TEMPLE AND OF SUNDRY LIMNINGS OF A
     RIGHT PACIFIC AND AMOROUS SORT THE WHICH THE SAGE PHILEMON
     HAD HANGED IN HIS LIBRARIE AND OF A NOBLE PORTRAITURE OF THE
     POET HOMER THE WHICH THE AFORESAID PHILEMON DID PRIZE ABOVE
     ALL OTHER LIMNINGS
</pre>
    <p>
      PHILEMON was used to confess how, in the fire of his callow youth and fine
      flower of his lustie springal days, he had been stung with murderous
      frenzie at view of a certaine picture of Apelles, the which in those times
      was showed in a temple. And the said picture did present Alexander the
      Great laying on right shrewdly at Darius, king of the Indians, whiles
      round about these twain, soldiers and captains were a-slaying one another
      with a savage furie and in divers strange fashions. And the said work was
      right cunningly wrought and in very close mimicrie of nature. And none, an
      they were in the hot and lustie season of their life, could cast a look
      thereon without being stirred incontinent to be striking and killing poor
      harmlesse folk for the sole sake of donning so rich an harnesse and
      bestriding such high-stepping chargers as did these good codpieces in
      their battle,&mdash;for that young blood doth aye take pleasure in
      horseflesh and the practise of arms. This had the aforesaid Philemon
      proven in his day. And he was used to say how ever after &lsquo;twas his wont to
      turn aside his eyen of set purpose from suchlike pictures of wars and
      bloodshed, and that he did so heartily loathe these cruelties as that he
      could not abear to behold them even set forth in counterfeit presentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was used to say that any honest and prudent wight must needs be
      sore offended and scandalized by all this appalling array of armour and
      bucklers and the horde of warriors Homer calls <i>Corythaioloi</i>
      (glancing-helmed) by reason of the terrifying hideousness of their
      head-gear, and that the portrayal of these same fighting fellows was in
      very truth unseemly, as contrarie to good and peaceable manners, immodest,
      no thing in the world being more shameful then homicide, and eke
      lascivious, as alluring folk to cruelty, the which is the worst of all
      allurements. For to entice to pleasant dalliaunce is a far lesse heinous
      fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the aforesaid Philemon was used to say that it was honest, decent, of
      good ensample and entirely modest to show by painting, chiselling, or any
      other fine artifice the scenes of the Golden Age, to wit maidens and young
      men interlacing limbs in accord with the craving of kindly Nature, or
      other the like delectable fancy, as of a Nymph lying laughing in the
      grass. And on her ripe smiling mouth a Faun is crushing a purple grape.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was used to say that belike the Golden Age had never flourished
      save only in the fond imagining of the poets, and that our first forebears
      of human kind, being yet barbarous and silly folk, had known naught at all
      thereof; but that, an the said age could not credibly be deemed to have
      been at the beginning of the world, we might well wish it should be at the
      end, and that meanwhiles it was a gracious boon to offer us a likeness of
      the same in pictured image.
    </p>
    <p>
      And like as it is (so he would say) obscene,&mdash;&lsquo;t is the word Virgil
      writes of dogs wallowing in the mud and mire,&mdash;to depict murderers,
      whoreson men-at arms, fighting-men, conquering heroes and plundering
      thieves, wreaking their foul and wicked will, yea! and poor devils licking
      the dust and swallowing the same in great mouthfuls, and one unhappie
      wretch that hath been felled to the earth and is striving to get to his
      feet againe, but is pinned down by an horse&rsquo;s hoof pressing on his chops,
      and another that looketh piteously about him for that his pennon hath been
      shorn from him and his hand with it,&mdash;so is it of right subtile and
      so to say heavenly art to exhibit prettie blandishments, caresses,
      frolickings, beauties and delights, and the loves of the Nymphs and Fauns
      in the woods. And he would have it there was none offence in these naked
      bodies, clothed upon enow with their owne grace and comeliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had in his closet, this same Philemon aforesaid, a very marvellous
      painting, wherein was limned a young Faun in act to filch away with a
      craftie hand a light cloth did cover the belly of a sleeping Nymph. &lsquo;T was
      plain to see he was full fain of his freak and seemed to be saying: The
      body of this young goddess is so sweet and refreshing as that the
      fountaine springing in the shade of the woods is not more delightsome. How
      I do love to look upon you, soft sweet lap, and prettie white thighs, and
      shady cavern at once terrifying and entrancing! And over the heads of the
      twain did hover winged Cupids and watched them laughingly, whiles fair
      dames and their gallants, their brows wreathen with flowers, footed it on
      the lush grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had, the aforesaid Philemon, yet other limnings of cunning
      craftsmanship in his closet. And he did prize very high the portraiture of
      a good doctor a-sitting in his cabinet writing at a table by candle-light.
      The said cabinet was fully furnished with globes, gnomons, and astrolabes,
      proper for meting the movements of the orbs of heaven, the which is a
      right praiseworthy task and one that doth lift the spirit to sublime
      thoughts and the exceeding pure love of Venus Urania.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was hanging from the joists of the said cabinet a great serpent
      and crocodile, forasmuch as they be rarities and very needful for the due
      understanding of anatomy. And he had likewise, the said doctor, amid his
      belongings, the books of the most excellent philosophers of Antiquity and
      eke the treatises of Hippocrates. And he was an ensample to young men
      which should be fain, by hard swinking, to stuff their pates with as much
      high learning and occult lore as he had under his own bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had, the aforesaid Philemon, painted on a panel that shined like a
      polished mirror a portraiture of Homer in the guise of an old blind man,
      his beard white as the flowers of the hawthorn and his temples bound about
      with the fillets sacred to the god Apollo, which had loved him above all
      other men. And, to look at that good old man, you deemed verily his lips
      were presently to ope and break into words of mélodie.

    <p>
      ON January 1st, in the forenoon, the good M. Chanterelle sallied out on
      foot from his hôtel in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. He felt the cold and was
      a poor walker; so it was a real penance to him to face the chilly air and
      the bleak streets which were full of half-melted snow. He had refused to
      take his coach by way of mortifying the flesh, having grown very
      solicitous since his illness about the salvation of his soul. He lived in
      retirement, aloof from all society and company, and paid no visits save to
      his niece, Mademoiselle de Doucine, a little girl of seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning on his walking-cane, he made his way painfully to the Rue
      Saint-Honoré and entered the shop of Madame Pinson at the sign of the <i>Panier
      Fleuri</i>. Here was displayed an abundant stock of children&rsquo;s toys to
      tempt customers seeking presents for this New Year&rsquo;s Day of 1696. You
      could scarce move for the host of mechanical figures of dancers and
      tipplers, birds in the bush that clapped their wings and sang, cabinets
      full of wax puppets, soldiers in white and blue ranged in battle array,
      and dolls dressed some as fine ladies, others as servant wenches, for the
      inequality of stations, established by God himself among mankind, appeared
      even in these innocent mannikins.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Chanterelle chose a doll. The one he selected was dressed like the
      Princess of Savoy on her arrival in France, on November 4th. The head was
      a mass of bows and ribbons; she wore a very stiff corsage, covered with
      gold filigrees, and a brocade petticoat with an overskirt caught up by
      pearl clasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Chanterelle smiled to think of the delight such a lovely doll would
      give Mademoiselle de Doucine, and when Madame Pinson handed him the
      Princess of Savoy wrapped up in silk paper, a gleam of sensuous
      satisfaction flitted over his kind face, pinched as it was with illness,
      pale with fasting and haggard with the fear of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thanked Madame Pinson courteously, clapped the Princess under his arm
      and walked away, dragging his leg painfully, towards the house where he
      knew Mademoiselle de Doucine was waiting for him to attend her morning
      levée.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of the Rue de l&rsquo; Arbre-Sec, he met M. Spon, whose great nose
      dived almost into his lace cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Monsieur Spon,&rdquo; he greeted him. &ldquo;I wish you a happy New
      Year, and I pray God everything may turn out according to your wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my good sir, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; cried M. Spon. &ldquo;&lsquo;T is often for our
      chastisement that God grants our wishes. <i>Et tribuit eis petittonem
      eorum</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis very true,&rdquo; returned M. Chanterelle, &ldquo;we do not know our own best
      interests. I am an example myself, as I stand before you. I thought at
      first that the complaint I have suffered from for the last two years was a
      curse; but I see now it is a blessing, since it has removed me from the
      abominable life I was leading at the play-houses and in society. This
      complaint, which tortures my limbs and is like to turn my brain, is a
      signal token of God&rsquo;s goodness toward me. But, sir, will you not do me the
      favour to accompany me as far as the Rue du Roule, whither I am bound, to
      carry a New Year&rsquo;s gift to my niece Mademoiselle de Doucine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words M. Spon threw up his arms and gave a great cry of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Can it be M. Chanterelle I hear say such things,&mdash;and
      not some profligate libertine? Is it possible, sir, that living as you do
      a religious and retired life, I see you all in a moment plunge into the
      vices of the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alack! I did not think I was plunging into vice,&rdquo; faltered M.
      Chanterelle, trembling all over. &ldquo;But I sorely lack a lamp of guidance. Is
      it so great a sin then to offer a doll to Mademoiselle de Doucine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a great and terrible sin,&rdquo; replied M. Spon. &ldquo;And what you are
      offering this innocent child to-day is meeter to be called an idol, a
      devilish simulacrum, than a doll. Are you not aware, sir, that the custom
      of New Year&rsquo;s gifts is a foul superstition and a hideous survival of
      Paganism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not know that,&rdquo; said M. Chanterelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me tell you, then,&rdquo; resumed M. Spon, &ldquo;that this custom descends from
      the Romans, who seeing something divine in all beginnings, held the
      beginning of the year holy also. Hence, to act as they did is to do
      idolatry. You make New Year&rsquo;s offerings, sir, in imitation of the
      worshippers of the God Janus. Be consistent, and like them consecrate to
      Juno the first day of every month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Chanterelle, hardly able to keep his feet, begged M. Spon to give him
      his arm, and while they moved on, M. Spon proceeded in the same vein:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because the Astrologers have fixed on the first of January for the
      beginning of the year that you deem yourself obliged to make presents on
      that day? Pray, what call have you to revive at that precise date the
      affection of your friends. Was their love dying then with the dying year?
      And will it be so much worth the having when you have reanimated it by
      dint of cajolements and baneful gifts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; returned the good M. Chanterelle, leaning on M. Spon&rsquo;s arm and
      trying hard to make his tottering steps keep pace with his impetuous
      companion&rsquo;s, &ldquo;sir, before my sickness, I was only a miserable sinner,
      taking no heed but to treat my friends with civility and govern my
      behaviour by the principles of honesty and honour. Providence hath deigned
      to rescue me from this abyss, and I direct my conduct since my conversion
      by the admonitions the Director of my conscience gives me. But I have been
      so light-minded and thoughtless as not to seek his advice on this question
      of New Year&rsquo;s gifts. What you tell me of them, sir, with the authority of
      a man alike admirable for sober living and sound doctrine, amazes and
      confounds me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! that is indeed what I mean to do,&rdquo; resumed M. Spon,&mdash;&ldquo;to
      confound you, and to illumine you, not indeed by my own lights, which burn
      feebly, but by those of a great Doctor. Sit you down on that wayside
      post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And pushing M. Chanterelle into the archway of a carriage gate, where he
      made himself as easy as circumstances allowed, M. Spon drew from his
      pocket a little parchment-bound book, which he opened, and after hunting
      through the pages, lighted on a passage which he proceeded to read out
      loud amid a gaping circle of chimney-sweeps, chamber-maids, and scullions
      who had collected at the resounding tones of his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We who hold in abhorrence the festivals of the Jews, and who would deem
      strange and outlandish their Sabbaths and New Moons and other Holy Days
      erst loved of the Almighty, we deal familiarly with the Saturnalia and the
      Calends of January, with the Matronalia and the Feast of the Winter
      Solstice; New Year&rsquo;s gifts and foolish presents fill all our thoughts;
      merrymakings and junketings are in every house. The Heathens guard their
      religion better; they are heedful to observe none of our Feasts, for fear
      of being taken for Christians, while we never hesitate to make ourselves
      look like Heathens by celebrating their Ceremonial Days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear what I say,&rdquo; went on M. Spon. &ldquo;&lsquo;T is Tertullian speaks in this
      wise and from the depths of Africa displays before your eyes, sir, the
      odiousness of your behaviour. He it is upbraids you, declaring how &lsquo;New
      Year&rsquo;s gifts and foolish presents fill all your thoughts. You keep holy
      the feasts of the Heathen.&rsquo; I have not the honour to know your Confessor.
      But I shudder, sir, to think of the way he neglects his duty toward you.
      Tell me this, can you rest assured that at the day of your death, when you
      come to stand before God, he will be at your side, to take upon him the
      sins he hath suffered you to fall into?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After haranguing in this sort, he put back his book in his pocket and
      marched off with angry strides, followed at a distance by the astonished
      chimney-sweeps and scullions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good M. Chanterelle was left sitting alone on his post with the
      Princess of Savoy, and thinking how he was risking the eternal pains of
      hell fire for giving a doll to Mademoiselle de Doucine, his niece, he fell
      to pondering the unfathomable mysteries of Religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legs, which had been tottery for several months, refused to carry him,
      and he felt as unhappy as ever a well-meaning man possibly can in this
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been sitting stranded in this distressful mood on his post for some
      minutes when a Capuchin friar stepped up and addressed him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, will you not give New Year&rsquo;s presents to the Little Brethren who are
      poor, for the love of God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! what! good Father,&rdquo; M. Chan-terelle burst out, &ldquo;you are a man of
      religion, and you ask me for New Year&rsquo;s gifts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the Capuchin, &ldquo;the good St. Francis bade his sons make
      merry with all simplicity. Give the Capuchins wherewith to make a good
      meal this day, that they may endure with cheerfulness the abstinence and
      fasting they must observe all the rest of the year,&mdash;barring, of
      course, Sundays and Feast Days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Chanterelle gazed at the holy man with wonder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you not afraid, Father, that this custom of New Year&rsquo;s gifts is
      baneful to the soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The custom comes to us from the Pagans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Pagans sometimes followed good customs. God was pleased to suffer
      some faint rays of his light to pierce the darkness of the Gentiles. Sir,
      if you refuse to give <i>us</i> presents, never refuse a boon to our poor
      little ones. We have a home for foundlings. With this poor crown I shall
      buy each child a little paper windmill and a cake. They will owe you the
      only pleasure perhaps of all their life; for they are not fated to have
      much joy in the world. Their laughter will go up to heaven; when children
      laugh, they praise the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      M. Chanterelle laid his well-filled purse in the poor friar&rsquo;s palm and got
      him down from his post, saying over softly to himself the word he had just
      heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When children laugh, they praise the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then his soul was comforted and he marched off with a firmer step to carry
      the Princess of Savoy to Mademoiselle de Doucine, his niece.

      MY good master, M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard, had taken me with him to sup with one
      of his old fellow-students, who lodged in a garret in the Rue Gît-le-Cour.
      Our host, a Premonstratensian Father of much learning and a fine
      Theologian, had fallen out with the Prior of his House for having writ a
      little book relating the calamities of Mam&rsquo;zelle Fanchon. The end of it
      was he turned tavern-keeper at The Hague. He was now returned to France
      and living precariously by the sermons he composed, which were full of
      high argument and eloquence. After supper he had read us these same
      calamities of Mam&rsquo;zelle Fanchon, source of his own, and the reading had
      kept us there till a late hour. At last I found myself without-doors with
      my good master, under a wondrous fine summer&rsquo;s night, which made me
      straightway comprehend the verity of the ancient fables regarding the
      loves of Diana and feel how natural it is to employ in soft dalliance the
      silent, silvery hours of night. I said as much to M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard, who
      retorted that love is to blame for many and great ills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tournebroche, my son,&rdquo; he asked me, &ldquo;have you not just heard from the
      mouth of yonder good Monk how, for having loved a recruiting sergeant, a
      clerk of M. Gaulot&rsquo;s mercer at the sign of the Truie-qui-file, and the
      younger son of M. le Lieutenant-Criminel Leblanc, Mam&rsquo;zelle Fanchon was
      clapped in hospital? Would you wish to be any of these,&mdash;sergeant or
      clerk or limb of the law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered I would indeed. My good master thanked me for my candid avowal,
      and quoted some verses of Lucretius to persuade me that love is contrary
      to the tranquillity of a truly philosophical soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus discoursing, we were come to the round-point of the Pont-Neuf.
      Leaning our elbows on the parapet, we looked over at the great tower of
      the Châtelet, which stood out black in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be much to say,&rdquo; sighed my good master, &ldquo;on this justice of
      the civilized nations, the punishments whereof in retaliation are often
      more cruel than the crime itself I cannot believe that these tortures and
      penalties that men inflict on their fellows are necessary for the
      safeguarding of States, seeing how from time to time one and another legal
      cruelty is done away with without hurt to the commonweal. And I hold it
      likely that the severities they still maintain are no whit more useful
      than those they have abolished. But men are cruel. Come away,
      Tournebroche, my dear lad; it grieves me to think how unhappy prisoners
      are even now lying awake behind those walls in anguish and despair. I know
      they have done faultily, but this doth not hinder me from pitying them.
      Which of us is without offence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went on our way. The bridge was deserted save for a beggarman and
      woman, who met on the causeway. The pair drew stealthily into one of the
      recesses over the piers, where they lurked together on the door-step of a
      hucksters booth. They seemed well enough content, both of them, to mingle
      their joint wretchedness, and when we went by were thinking of quite other
      things than craving our charity. Nevertheless my good master, who was the
      most compassionate of men, threw them a half farthing, the last piece of
      money left in his breeches pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will pick up our obol,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when they have come back to the
      consciousness of their misery. I pray they may not quarrel then over
      fiercely for possession of the coin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We passed on without further rencounter till on the Quai des Oiseleurs we
      espied a young damsel striding along with a notable air of resolution.
      Hastening our pace to get a nearer view, we saw she had a slim waist and
      fair hair in which the moonbeams played prettily. She was dressed like a
      citizen&rsquo;s wife or daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes a pretty girl,&rdquo; said the Abbé; &ldquo;how comes it she is out of
      doors alone at this hour of night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;&lsquo;tis not the sort one generally encounters on the
      bridges after curfew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our surprise was changed to alarm when we saw her go down to the river
      bank by a little stairway the sailors use. We ran towards her; but she did
      not seem to hear us. She halted at the edge; the stream was running high,
      and the dull roar of the swollen waters could be heard some way off. She
      stood a moment motionless, her head thrown back and arms hanging, in an
      attitude of despair. Then, bending her graceful neck, she put her two
      hands over her face and kept it hid behind her fingers for some seconds.
      Next moment she suddenly grasped her skirts and dragged them forward with
      the gesture a woman always uses when she is going to jump. My good master
      and I came up with her just as she was taking the fatal leap, and we
      hauled her forcibly backward. She struggled to get free of our arms; and
      as the bank was all slimy and slippery with ooze deposited by the receding
      waters (for the river was already beginning to fall), M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard
      came very near being dragged in too. I was losing my foothold myself. But
      as luck would have it, my feet lighted on a root which held me up as I
      crouched there with my arms round the best of masters and this despairing
      young thing. Presently, coming to the end of her strength and courage, she
      fell back on M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard&rsquo;s breast, and we managed all three to
      scramble to the top of the bank again. He helped her up daintily, with a
      certain easy grace that was always his. Then he led the way to a great
      beech-tree at the foot of which was a wooden bench, on which he seated
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his place beside her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;you need have no fear. Say nothing just
      yet, but be assured it is a friend sits by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, turning to me, my master went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tournebroche, my son, we may congratulate ourselves on having brought
      this strange adventure to a good end. But I have left my hat down yonder
      on the river bank; albeit it has lost pretty near all its lace and is
      thread-bare with long service, it was still good to guard my old head,
      sorely tried by years and labours, against sun and rain. Go see, my son,
      if it may still be found where I dropped it. And if you discover it, bring
      it me, I beg,&mdash;likewise one of my shoe buckles, which I see I have
      lost. For my part I will stay by this damsel we have rescued and watch
      over her slumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran back to the spot we had just quitted and was lucky enough to find my
      good master&rsquo;s hat. The buckle I could not espy anywhere. True, I did not
      take any very excessive pains to hunt for it, having never all my life
      seen my good master with more than one shoe buckle. When I returned to the
      tree, I found the damsel still in the same state, sitting quite motionless
      with her head leant against the trunk of the beech. I noticed now that she
      was of a very perfect beauty. She wore a silk mantle trimmed with lace,
      very neat and proper, and on her feet light shoes, the buckles of which
      caught the moonbeams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not have enough of examining her. Suddenly she opened her drooping
      lids, and casting a look that was still misty at M. Coignard and me, she
      began in a feeble voice, but with the tone and accent, I thought, of a
      person of gentility:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ungrateful, sirs, for the service you have done me from feelings
      of humanity; but I cannot truthfully tell you I am glad, for the life to
      which you have restored me is a curse, a hateful, cruel torment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these sad words my good master, whose face wore a look of compassion,
      smiled softly, for he could not really think life was to be for ever
      hateful to so young and pretty a creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;things strike us in a totally different light
      according as they are near at hand or far off. It is no time for you to
      despair. Such as I am, and brought to this sorry plight by the buffets of
      time and fortune, I yet make shift to endure a life wherein my pleasures
      are to translate Greek and dine sometimes with sundry very worthy friends.
      Look at me, mademoiselle, and say,&mdash;would you consent to live in the
      same conditions as I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him over; her eyes almost laughed, and she shook her head.
      Then, resuming her melancholy and mournfulness, she faltered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not in all the world so unhappy a being as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; returned my good master, &ldquo;I am discreet both by calling
      and temperament; I will not seek to force your confidence. But your looks
      betray you; any one can see you are sick of disappointed love. Well, &lsquo;t is
      not an incurable complaint. I have had it myself, and I have lived many a
      long year since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, gave her a thousand tokens of his sympathy, and went on
      in these terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is only one thing I regret for the moment,&mdash;that I cannot
      offer you a refuge for the night, or what is left of it. My present
      lodging is in an old château a long way from here, where I am busy
      translating a Greek book along with young Master Tournebroche whom you see
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My master spoke the truth. We were living at the time with M. d&rsquo;Astarac,
      at the Château des Sablons, in the village of Neuilly, and were in the pay
      of a great alchemist, who died later under tragic circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the same time, mademoiselle,&rdquo; my master added, &ldquo;if you should know of
      any place where you think you could go, I shall be happy to escort you
      thither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which the girl answered she appreciated all his kindness, that she
      lived with a kinswoman, to whose house she could count on being admitted
      at any hour; but that she had rather not return before daylight. She was
      fain, she said, not to disturb quiet folks&rsquo; sleep, and dreaded moreover to
      have her grief too painfully renewed by the sight of her old, familiar
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke thus, the tears rained down from her eyes. My good master
      bade her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle, give me your handkerchief, if you please, and I will wipe
      your eyes. Then I will take you to wait for daybreak under the archways of
      the Halles, where we can sit in comfort under shelter from the night
      dews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to give you so much trouble. Go your way, sir,
      and rest assured you take my best thanks with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For all that she laid her hand on the arm my good master offered her, and
      we set out, all the three of us, for the Halles. The night had turned much
      cooler. In the sky, which was beginning to assume a milky hue, the stars
      were growing paler and fainter. We could hear the first of the
      market-gardeners&rsquo; carts rumbling along to the Halles, drawn by a
      slow-stepping horse, half asleep in the shafts. Arrived at the archways,
      we chose a place in the recess of a porch distinguished by an image of St.
      Nicholas, and established ourselves all three on a stone step, on which M.
      l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard took the precaution of spreading his cloak before he let
      his young charge sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon my good master fell to discoursing on divers subjects, choosing
      merry and enlivening themes of set purpose to drive away the gloomy
      thoughts that might assail our companion&rsquo;s mind. He told her he accounted
      this rencounter the most fortunate he had ever chanced on all his life,
      and that he should ever cherish a fond recollection of one who had so
      deeply touched him,&mdash;all this, however, without ever asking to know
      her name and story.
    </p>
    <p>
      My good master thought no doubt that the unknown would presently tell him
      what he refrained from asking. She broke into a fresh flood of weeping,
      heaved a deep sigh and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be churlish, sir, to reward your kindness with silence. I am not
      afraid to trust myself in your hands. My name is Sophie T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.
      You have guessed the truth; &lsquo;tis the betrayal of a lover I was too fondly
      attached to has brought me to despair. If you deem my grief excessive,
      that is because you do not know how great was my assurance, how blind my
      infatuation, and you cannot realize how enchanting was the paradise I have
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, raising her lovely eyes to our faces, she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sirs, I am not such a woman as your meeting me thus at night time might
      lead you to suppose. My father was a merchant. He went, in the way of
      trade, to America, and was lost on his way home in a shipwreck, he and his
      merchandise with him. My mother was so overwhelmed by these calamities
      that she fell into a decline and died, leaving me, while still a child, to
      the charge of an aunt, who brought me up. I was a good girl till the hour
      I met the man whose love was to afford me indescribable delights, ending
      in the despair wherein you now see me plunged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Sophie hid her face in her handkerchief. Presently she resumed
      with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His worldly rank was so far above my own I could never expect to be his
      except in secret. I flattered myself he would be faithful to me. He swore
      he loved me, and easily overcame my scruples. My aunt was aware of our
      feelings for one another, and raised no obstacles, for two reasons,&mdash;because
      her affection for me made her indulgent, and because my dear lover&rsquo;s high
      position impressed her imagination. I lived a year of perfect happiness
      only equalled by the wretchedness I now endure. This morning he came to
      see me at my aunt&rsquo;s, with whom I live. I was haunted by dark forebodings.
      As I dressed my hair but an hour or so before, I had broken a mirror he
      had given me. The sight of him only increased my misgivings, for I noticed
      instantly that his face wore an unaccustomed look of constraint... Oh!
      sir, was ever woman so unhappy as I?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes filled again with tears; but she kept them back under her lids,
      and was able to finish her tale, which my good master deemed as touching,
      but by no means so unique, as she did herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He informed me coldly, though not without signs of embarrassment, that
      his father having bought him a Company, he was leaving to join the
      colours. First, however, he said, his family required him to plight his
      troth to the daughter of an Intendant of Finances; the connection was
      advantageous to his fortune and would bring him means adequate to support
      his rank and make a figure in the world. And the traitor, never deigning
      to notice my pale looks, added in his soft, caressing voice which had made
      me so many vows of affection, that his new obligations would prevent his
      seeing me again, at least for some while. He assured me further that he
      was still my friend and begged me to accept a sum of money in memory of
      the days we had passed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with the words he held out a purse to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling you the truth, sirs, when I assure you I had always refused
      to listen to the offers he repeated again and again, to give me fine
      clothes, furniture, plate, an establishment, and to take me away from my
      aunt&rsquo;s, where I lived in very narrow circumstances, and settle me in a
      most elegant little mansion he had in the Rue di Roule. My wish was that
      we should be united only by the ties of affection, and I was proud to have
      of his gift nothing but a few jewels whose sole value came from the fact
      of his being the donor. My gorge rose at the sight of the purse he offered
      me, and the insult gave me strength to banish from my presence the
      impostor whom in one moment I had learnt to know and to despise. He faced
      my angry looks unabashed, and assured me with the utmost unconcern that I
      could know nothing of the paramount obligations that fill the existence of
      a man of quality, adding that he hoped eventually, when I looked at things
      quietly, I should come to see his behaviour in a better light. Then,
      returning the purse to his pocket, he declared he would readily find a way
      of putting the contents at my disposal in such a manner as to make it
      impossible for me to refuse his liberality. Thus leaving me with the
      odious, the intolerable implication that he was going to make full amends
      by these sordid means, he made for the door to which I pointed without a
      word. When he was gone, I felt a calmness of mind that surprised myself.
      It arose from the resolution I had formed to die. I dressed with some
      care, wrote a letter to my aunt asking her forgiveness for the pain I was
      about to cause her by my death, and went out into the streets. There I
      roamed about all the afternoon and evening and a part of the night, moving
      from busy thoroughfare to deserted lane without a trace of fatigue,
      postponing the execution of my purpose to make it more sure and certain
      under the favouring conditions of darkness and solitude. Possibly too I
      found a certain weak pleasure in dallying with the thought of dying and
      tasting the mournful satisfaction of my coming release from my troubles.
      At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I went down to the river&rsquo;s brink. Sirs, you
      know the rest,&mdash;you snatched me from a watery grave. I thank you for
      your goodness,&mdash;though I am sorry you saved my life. The world is
      full of forsaken women. I did not wish to add another to the number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophie then fell silent and began weeping afresh. My good master took her
      hand with the greatest delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have listened with a tender interest to the story
      of your life, and I own &lsquo;tis a sad tale. But I am happy to discern that
      your case is curable. Not only was your lover unworthy of the favours you
      showed him and has proved himself on trial a selfish, cruel-hearted
      libertine, but I see plainly your love for him was only an impulse of the
      senses and the effect of your own sensibility, the particular object of
      which mattered far less than you imagine. What there was rare and
      excellent in the liaison came from you. Well then, nothing is lost, since
      the source still remains. Your eyes, which have thrown a glamour of the
      fairest hues over, I doubt not, a very ordinary individual, will not cease
      to go on shedding abroad elsewhere the same bright rays of charming
      self-delusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My good master said more in the same strain, dropping from his lips the
      finest words ever heard anent the tribulations of the senses and the
      errors lovers are prone to. But, as he talked on, Sophie, who for some
      while had let her pretty head droop on the shoulder of this best of men,
      fell softly asleep. When M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard saw his young friend was
      wrapped in a sound slumber, he congratulated himself on having discoursed
      in a vein so meet to afford repose and peace to a suffering soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be allowed,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;my sermons have a beneficent effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not to disturb Mademoiselle&rsquo;s slumbers, he took a thousand pretty
      precautions, amongst others constraining himself to talk on
      uninterruptedly, not unreasonably apprehensive that a sudden silence might
      awake her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tournebroche, my son,&rdquo; he said, turning to me, &ldquo;look, all her sorrows are
      vanished away with the consciousness she had of them. You must see they
      were all of the imagination and resided in her own thought. You must
      understand likewise they sprang from a certain pride and overweening
      conceit that goes along with love and makes it very exacting. For, in
      truth, if only we loved in humbleness of spirit and forgetfulness of self,
      or merely with a simple heart, we should be content with what is
      vouchsafed us and should not straightway cry treason when some slight is
      put on us. And if some power of loving were left us still, after our lover
      had deserted us, we should await the issue in calmness of mind to make
      what use of it God should please to grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the day was just breaking by this time, and the song of the birds grew
      so loud it drowned my good master&rsquo;s voice. He made no complaint on this
      score.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the sparrows. They make love more wisely than men
      do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sophie awoke in the white light of dawn, and I admired her lovely eyes,
      which fatigue and grief had ringed with a delicate pearly-grey. She seemed
      somewhat reconciled to life, and did not refuse a cup of chocolate which
      my good master made her drink at Mathurine&rsquo;s door, the pretty
      chocolate-seller of the Halles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the poor child came into more complete possession of her wits, she
      began to trouble about sundry practical difficulties she had not thought
      of till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will my aunt say? And whatever can I tell her?&rdquo; she asked
      distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aunt lived just opposite Saint-Eustache, less than a hundred yards
      from Mathurine&rsquo;s archway. Thither we escorted her niece; and M. l&rsquo;Abbé
      Coignard, who had quite a venerable look, though one shoe <i>was</i>
      unbuckled, accompanied the fair Sophie to the door of her aunt&rsquo;s lodging
      and pitched that lady a fine tale:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the happy fortune,&rdquo; he informed her, &ldquo;to encounter your good niece
      at the very moment when she was assailed by four footpads armed with
      pistols, and I shouted for the watch so lustily that the thieves took to
      their heels in a panic. But they were not quick enough to escape the
      sergeants who, by the rarest chance, ran up in answer to my outcries. They
      arrested the villains after a desperate tussle. I took my share of the
      rough and tumble, and I thought at first I had lost my hat in the fray.
      When all was over, we were all taken, your niece, the four footpads and
      myself, before his Honour the Lieutenant-Criminel, who treated us with
      much consideration and detained us till daylight in his cabinet, taking
      down our evidence.&rdquo; The aunt answered drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir, for having saved my niece from a peril which, to say
      the truth, is not the risk a girl of her age need fear the most, when she
      is out alone at night in the streets of Paris.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My good master made no answer to this; but Mademoiselle Sophie spoke up
      and said in a voice of deep feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do assure you, Aunt, Monsieur l&rsquo;Abbé saved my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Some years after this singular adventure, my master made the fatal journey
      to Lyons from which he never returned. He was foully murdered, and I had
      the ineffable grief of seeing him expire in my arms. The incidents of his
      death have no connexion with the matter I speak of here. I have taken
      pains to record them elsewhere; they are indeed memorable, and will never,
      I think, be forgotten. I may add that this journey was in all ways
      unfortunate, for after losing the best of masters on the road, I was
      likewise forsaken by a mistress who loved me, but did not love me alone,
      and whose loss nearly broke my heart, coming after that of my good master.
      It is a mistake to suppose that a man who has received one cruel blow
      grows callous to succeeding strokes of calamity. Far otherwise; he suffers
      agonies from the smallest contrarieties. I returned to Paris in a state of
      dejection almost beyond belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, one evening, by way of enlivening my spirits, I went to the Comédie,
      where they were playing <i>Bajazet</i>, one of Racine&rsquo;s excellent pieces.
      I was particularly struck by the charm and beauty, no less than the
      originality and talent, of the actress who took the part of Roxane. She
      expressed with a delightful naturalness the passion animating that
      character, and I shuddered as I heard her declaim in accents that were
      harmonious and yet terrible the line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Écoutez  Bajazet, je sens que je vous aime.{*}

     * &ldquo;Hearken, Bajazet, I feel I love you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I never wearied of gazing at her all the time she occupied the stage, and
      admiring the beauty of her eyes that gleamed below a brow as pure as
      marble and crowned by powdered locks all spangled with pearls. Her slender
      waist too, which her hoop showed off to perfection, did not fail to make a
      vivid impression on my heart. I had the better leisure to scrutinize these
      adorable charms as she happened to face in my direction to deliver several
      important portions of her rôle. And the more I looked, the more I felt
      convinced I had seen her before, though I found it impossible to recall
      anything connected with our previous meeting. My neighbour in the theatre,
      who was a constant frequenter of the Comédie, told me the beautiful
      actress was Mademoiselle B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, the idol of the pit. He
      added that she was as great a favourite in society as on the boards, that
      M. le Duc de La &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; had made her the fashion and that
      she was on the highroad to eclipse Mademoiselle Lecouvreur.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was just leaving my seat after the performance when a &ldquo;femme de chambre&rdquo;
       handed me a note in which I found written in pencil the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mademoiselle Roxane is waiting for you in her coach at the theatre
      door</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could not believe the missive was intended for me; and I asked the
      abigail who had delivered it if she was not mistaken in the recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I <i>am</i> mistaken,&rdquo; she replied confidently, &ldquo;then you cannot be
      Monsieur de Tournebroche, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ran to the coach which stood waiting in front of the House, and inside I
      recognized Mademoiselle B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, her head muffled in a
      black satin hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She beckoned to me to get in, and when I was seated beside her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not,&rdquo; she asked me, &ldquo;recognize Sophie, whom you rescued from
      drowning on the banks of the Seine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you! Sophie&mdash;Roxane&mdash;Mademoiselle B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      is it possible?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My confusion was extreme, but she appeared to view it without annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;in one corner of the pit. I knew you instantly
      and played for you. Say, did I play well? I am so glad to see you again!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked me news of M. l&rsquo;Abbé Coignard, and when I told her my good
      master had just perished miserably, she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was good enough to inform me of the chief events of her life:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aunt,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;used to mend her laces for Madame de Saint-Remi,
      who, as you must know, is an admirable actress. A short while after the
      night when you did me such yeoman service, I went to her house to take
      home some pieces of lace. The lady told me I had a face that interested
      her. She then asked me to read some verses, and concluded I was not
      without wits. She had me trained. I made my first appearance at the
      Comédie last year. I interpret passions I have felt myself, and the public
      credits me with some talent. M. le Duc de La &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      exhibits a very dear friendship for me, and I think he will never cause me
      pain and disappointment, because I have learnt to ask of men only what
      they can give. At this moment he is expecting me at supper. I must not
      break my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, reading my vexation in my eyes, she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, I have told my people to go the longest way round and to drive
      slowly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
